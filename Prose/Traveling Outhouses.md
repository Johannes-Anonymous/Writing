- Rewrite, and use it to create a history museum infographic (with many images)
- include more jokes
    - characters should panic in Chapter 6 after their outhouses are destroyed — what will they do? Will they have to return to civilization? (Are all the outhouses destroyed?)
    - a significant poop joke should be made at the end, perhaps through a revelation of the meaning of the brothers' names or the names of the outhouses

# The Story

## Chapter 1

Generations ago,
the west was wild, unsettled,
and to common folk, unknown.

They dreamt of it often.

Yet, only fools, fugitives, and the unnaturally fearless had gone forth, as it was a dangerous expanse:
few ventured into it,
and fewer stories returned.

Eventually, this changed, and the change began with a family living at the edge of the wilderness.

Daily they looked out west, deep into the open land, much like a painter looks upon a blank canvas.

For reasons known by their hearts alone, the husband and his wife journeyed forth with their children and a spartan set of possessions, all with determination in their eyes and grit between their teeth.

For reasons familiar to all,
they soon returned:

One of them had to poop.

To them — and all but the fools, fugitives, and unnaturally fearless — defecating outside the confines of an outhouse was a strange and embarrassing experience, one looked upon shamefully by all.

So after relieving themselves in their aged shack on the old home site, and with an unchanged lack of foresight, they set out again.

And again, they returned.

And so again, they set out.

And again, they returned.

Beyond doubt, they were a family of great determination, small intellects, and regular bowel movements.

So after many repetitions, with no diminishment to their resolve, they were looked on with sufficient pity by their angels above to warrant a bestowal of what became an epoch-shifting inspiration:

Why not take the outhouse with them?

And so they did.

## Chapter 2

The neighbors saw this, and nearly went into shock.

The thought of moving an outhouse from its original place was new, strange, and unsettling.

But after working through their bewilderment, they took to the idea and tried it themselves, and began following the first family.

Their trails were conspicuous.

Many other families soon followed, discovering a new freedom for travel that came with taking their outhouse with them.

The consequences were great, as no longer was civilized society's permanent expansion limited to the distance of a single day's journey (or slightly longer, if you were eating less).

As the distances grew, so did peoples' dreams and visions. For all, it felt like the dawn of a new age — one destined to be great and good.

## Chapter 3

However, the rough western country they went into remained rough, and it tore up the outhouses as they were dragged over the land. Soon, permanent settlements were again made, not out of desire or satisfaction with the progress achieved, but from bare necessity.

Repairing outhouses beyond trivial damages, or building new ones better equipped for travel, were even stranger ideas than that of moving ones already built, and they remained beyond the minds of all for a long time.

These were still a people of limited imagination and regular, predictable habits.

The exceptions were two brothers, Jack and John. With their sublime imaginations they devised the means for continued westward expansion, and with their great physical and moral strength made it a reality.

Their insight was even more culture-changing and expectation-shattering than that of dragging an outhouse over rocks and through fields and rivers.
They simply asked: Why not build an outhouse designed for such travel?

And failing to develop an answer, they began designing and building such an outhouse, first to the bewilderment, and then the boon of all.

Beyond the continued expansion and consequent cultural growth that their traveling outhouses brought, brothers Jack and John are also remembered and honored for another reason, one both great and tragic.

## Chapter 4

Jack and John were far east of the travelers and the long-stablished settlements on the civilization–wilderness divide first crossed by the enigmatic family.

So they did not leave their home before hearing many tales of outhouse trials and failures.

With their keen intellects, Jack and John did what no one else had, and solved almost all traveling-outhouse problems with one master stroke: they put wheels on the outhouse.

Then, they painted it red and headed west.

## Chapter 5

On their way, they passed through many of the settlements built around the broken outhouses, and soon their innovation of wheels on outhouses had spread, along with their names, to all who yearned to continue traveling west.

A following built up around Jack and John, and soon they found themselves leading the way out west. Their bravado, sharp intellects, and physical strength earned them the respect and devotion of all that followed.

## Chapter 6

It was on their second day of traveling through the canyon that they encountered the grizzlies.

The lead posse of travelers had reached the deep heart of the canyon, after descending through miles of a lush valley, when they met the bears.

X, the younger brother of Y, [ TODO: DETERMINE NAMES ] recalls that though he and others had seen such bears before — while still out east — they were surprised by this one's size and less cautious manner. Noting its lighter color and humped back, X thought, “This is a different type of bear entirely than what I'm used to — we may be in a bad situation.”

And such they were, for as he took stock of the animal, rough and chaotic sounds, soon followed by many cries, broke out behind him.

He turned back to face camp, and saw their outhouses being smashed and batted around by a group of bears, and those around still in a state of confusion and shock.

Then he saw his brother standing in the ruins of their outhouse — his trousers still partly undone — grappling and clawing at a bear much larger than him.

Jack and John ran up to him and together pulled and beat the bear away from Y, using broken boards to beat the animal on the snout.

They were wounded in the process.

Others were being chased, cornered, and attacked as well, and so Jack and John, with their formidable strength, continued to fight the bears.

They suffered many wounds.

In their exhaustion, they looked for a place to rest.

The nearest place to sit was on the seat of their own half-demolished outhouse.

So, mortally wounded, with the smote bodies of their enemies around them, Jack and John took their rest, and leaning on each other to remain upright, released their souls from this life, and on their throne, died.

Excepting the bears, they were the only fatalities that day; they had saved all the others.

## Chapter 7

Word of the heroism of Jack and John quickly spread through the chain of travelers, and their example gave the others the courage and fighting knowledge necessary to continue the push westward without further loss of life.

Jack and John left no offspring, but their impact on the history and hearts of all in the west was so great that they have many spiritual descendants, and whenever a newborn is sensed to have significant potential for strength of body or character, especially in the case of brothers (or if such strength is merely desired by the parents), they are named after the original brothers, or some part of their story.
