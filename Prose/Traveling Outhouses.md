- Rewrite, and use it to create a history museum infographic (with many images)

    - characters should panic in Chapter 6 after their outhouses are destroyed — what will they do? Will they have to return to civilization? (Are all the outhouses destroyed?)
    - a significant poop joke should be made at the end, perhaps through a revelation of the meaning of the brothers' names or the names of the outhouses

# The Story

## Chapter 1

Generations ago,
the west was wild, unsettled,
and to common folk, unknown.

They dreamt of it often.

Yet, only fools, fugitives, and the unnaturally fearless had gone forth, as it was a dangerous expanse:
few ventured into it,
and fewer stories returned.

Eventually, this changed, and the change began with a family who lived at the edge of the wilderness.

Daily they looked out over the land, deep into the open west, as a painter looks upon a blank canvas.

For reasons known by their hearts alone, the husband and his wife journeyed forth with their children and a spartan set of possessions, each of them with determination set deep in his eyes and grit between his teeth.

For reasons familiar to all,
they soon returned:

One of them had to poop.

To them — and all but the fools, fugitives, and unnaturally fearless — defecating outside the confines of an outhouse was a strange and embarrassing experience, and it was looked upon shamefully by all.

So after relieving themselves in their aged shack on the old home site, and with an unchanged lack of foresight, they again set out.

And again, they returned.

And so again, they set out.

And again, they returned.

Beyond doubt, they were a family of determination, small intellects, and regular bowel movements.

So after many repetitions, with no diminishment to their resolve, they were looked on with sufficient pity from their angels above to warrant a bestowal of what became an epoch-shifting inspiration:

Why not take the outhouse with themselves?

And so they did.

## Chapter 2

The family's neighbors saw what was done, and they nearly went into shock.

The thought of moving an outhouse from its original place was new, strange, and unsettling.

Soon, though, they took to the idea and tried it themselves, and began to follow the first family.

Their trails were conspicuous.

Many families from far around soon followed, discovering a new freedom for travel that came with taking their outhouse with them.

The consequences were great, as no longer was civilized society's permanent expansion limited to the distance of a single day's journey (or slightly longer, if you were eating less).

As the distances grew exponentially, so did people's hope and vision of themselves, and for the future. For all, it felt like the dawn of a new age — the beginning of a great, new good.

## Chapter 3

However, the rough country they went into remained rough, and it tore up the outhouses as they were dragged over the land. Soon, permanent settlements were again made, not out of desire or satisfaction with the progress achieved, but from bare necessity.

Repairing outhouses beyond the most trivial damages, or building new ones better equipped for travel, were even stranger ideas than that of moving ones already built, and these ideas remained beyond the minds of all for quite some time.

These were still a people of limited imagination and regular, predictable habits.

The exceptions were two brothers, who with their sublime imaginations devised the means for continued westward expansion, and with their great physical strength had the necessary means for making it a reality.

The idea they had was even more culture-changing and expectation-shattering than that of dragging an outhouse over rocks and through fields and rivers.
They asked the question: Why not build an outhouse designed for such travel?

Failing to develop a corresponding answer, they soon began designing and building such an outhouse, to the boon of all following generations.

And beyond the continued expansion and consequent cultural growth that their traveling outhouses brought, brothers John and Jack are today also remembered and honored for another reason, one both great and tragic.

## Chapter 4

John and Jack were far east of the travelers, and of the long-stablished settlements on the civilization–wilderness divide first crossed by the enigmatic family.

So they did not leave their home before hearing many tales of particular outhouse failures that were preventing further western travel.

With their keen intellects, John and Jack did what no one had yet thought out, and solved nearly all the traveling-outhouse problems with one master stroke: they put wheels on their outhouse.

Then, they painted it red and headed west.

## Chapter 5

On their way, they passed through many of the settlements built around the broken outhouses, and soon their innovation of wheels on outhouses had spread, along with their names, to all who yearned to continue traveling west.

A following built up around John and Jack, and soon they found themselves leading the way out west. Their bravado, sharp intellects, and physical strength earned them the respect and devotion of all that followed.

## Chapter 6

It was on their second day of traveling through the canyon that they encountered the grizzlies.

The lead posse of travelers had reached the deep heart of the canyon, after descending through miles of a lush valley, when they met the bears.

X, the younger brother of Y, [ TODO: DETERMINE NAMES ] recalls that though he and others had seen such bears before — while still out east — they were surprised by this one's size and less cautious manner. Noting its lighter color and humped back, X thought, “This is a different type of bear entirely than what I'm used to — we may be in a bad situation.”

And such they were, for as he took stock of the animal, rough and chaotic sounds, soon followed by many cries, broke out behind him.

He turned back to face camp, and saw their outhouses being smashed and batted around by a group of bears, and those around still in a state of confusion and shock.

Then he saw his brother standing in the ruins of their outhouse — his trousers still partly undone — grappling and clawing at a bear much larger than him.

John and Jack ran up to him and together pulled and beat the bear away from Y, using broken boards to beat the animal on the snout.

They were wounded in the process.

Others were being chased, cornered, and attacked as well, and so John and Jack, with their formidable strength, continued to fight the bears.

They suffered many wounds.

In their exhaustion, they looked for a place to rest.

The nearest place to sit was on the seat of their own half-demolished outhouse.

So, mortally wounded, with the smote bodies of their enemies around them, John and Jack took their rest, and leaning on each other to remain upright, released their souls from this life, and on their throne, died.

Excepting the bears, they were the only fatalities that day; they had saved all the others.

## Chapter 7

Word of the heroism of John and Jack quickly spread through the chain of travelers, and their example gave the others the courage and fighting knowledge necessary to continue the push westward without further loss of life.

John and Jack left no offspring, but their impact on the history and hearts of all in the west was so great that they have many spiritual descendants, and whenever a newborn is sensed to have significant potential for strength of body or character, especially in the case of brothers (or if such strength is merely desired by the parents), they are named after the original brothers, or some part of their story.
