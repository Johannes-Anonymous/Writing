The sun was well on its way down, yet a few hours of daylight remained. Over her shoulder I could see the bricks of the building across the alley glow red and gold in the light, and as I brought my eyes back to hers I was again struck by her gentleness, which seemed to give the air around her weight.

She started speaking again. "I remember the day my grandmother died well, but more so the night, once the news became real. Before dinner it was still just words we had expected to hear." She breathed, and I shifted weight. The open classroom desks were a few feet from us, and I would have liked to rest on one of them as we talked, but I could tell she was more comfortable standing; and anyways, she was beginning to enter into her story, to that place where it becomes more than just memory.

"My father was the first one to come home, where my brother Tom and I already were. I remember the evening feeling slow before that, and then the night feeling fast as Mom and the others came back soon after Dad. We had dinner together, and not much was really said, though we talked a lot."

"Grandpa had most of the logistics prepared before, and we were filled in on the details the next day. That night we shared a few stories of her, but I think we were laying the foundation for doing so more later. We talked a lot about the three months leading up to her death."
