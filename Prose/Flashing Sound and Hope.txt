I had just finished buckling in when my dad started the car, and the stereo came on suddenly; it was like a flash of sun across the windshield. The moment injected itself deep into my soul, never to be torn out.

The words, the harmonies, the clean timbre of the voices â€” these I have always remembered, as if the moment still lives, though it be in the past. I can, at will, reach back and enter into that wellspring of joy, of unanticipated hope, of foresight into a bright future I had never dreamt of but had a latent and untouched desire for; and I can follow that desire and hope back through the present and into a greater tomorrow.
