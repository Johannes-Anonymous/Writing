Jim had worked at the factory for a dozen years by the time I started. I met him in the air-conditioned bathroom, thankful for the bodily necessity which allowed me a reprieve from the hot, oppressive assembly line.

We made a short conversation, and when I asked and he told me how long he had worked there, something inside me shivered and kind of died.

After six or seven weeks of work, I felt depressed about the place and was struggling to summon the energy for the physical work and for the work of keeping my spirits up. I had felt that way since the second week.

I knew the station that Jim worked at. It was by itself, away from other people, and he was one of the few — maybe the only — whom I saw sitting down while he worked.

He had a kind of manic look in his face, and his eyes seemed slightly too small. He said he sometimes was required to work a double shift, so I knew that some days after he arrived and sat on his stool under fluorescent lights, the sun would rise, cross over all our land, and set again, without him ever seeing this, unless he were to stand up and walk away.
