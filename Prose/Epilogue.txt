She turns around as I'm bowing my head in exhaustion and says, “We're through!”
I hear the metal creak for a moment, and there's a little breeze that comes through the gap, carrying the scent of lilies.

After a few deaths, mangled limbs, missing persons and abandonments, and a more tightly packed cluster of betrayals, life-risking proofs of loyalty, surprising revelations of strength, and the forging of paradoxical friendships, this is the most shocking moment of all: the smell of lilies as we reach the apparent end of our journey.

I stand, turn about to see my friends, and we slowly start walking forward again. Leaving the steel walls behind us, I am grateful for the sun, now shining, and its warmth upon my neck.

Turning to behold the new ground around us, I begin to relax a little, and almost smile — indeed, there are flowers all around, and they are beautiful.
