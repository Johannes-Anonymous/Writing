I was twenty years old. Not old enough to drink, halfway through college, and as I saw it, halfway between the life I grew up in and one I didn't yet know.

This summer I was on a church-league softball team with high school friends. Two of them played baseball in school and were our team's strongest players. Their dad was our coach.

He was like an oak tree; sturdy, dependable, and not liable to move anywhere fast. He was deliberate with his actions, spoke confidently and humbly with a rough voice, and looked at you directly.

We were sharing the bench during an early-evening game. I had my face in the sun and cleats scraping the dugout when he asked me a question. "Joe, you have a sister, don't you?"

Suddenly, I did. Brought forth by the certainty in his voice came my sister, fully known in just a moment. She was a beautiful young woman with an open face and bright eyes, whose long blonde hair reminds me of my mother's high school photographs.

Here was blood of my blood, incarnate in the female form, reflective of the same goodness inside of me. She gave shape to our inner light in ways I could not, our differences complementary to each other and reflective of a greater whole. I was affirmed by her, as she was by me. We were in each other, proud of each other, and a great love lay between us.

She was known by others, and I was proud to stand beside her at family gatherings and in photographs.

In another moment this vision was gone. I must live in the truth, and in truth I have no sister.
