I pulled in to their driveway just before 8 p.m.; a good time, but far away from the estimate I gave them. I parked in the same spot as last year, and deliberately put my things in order.

It was one of the last nights in August, and the earliness of the sunset was noticeable and pleasant. There was now a decent hour of dark before bedtime.

The farm was quiet. I was greeted by their dog as I walked into the gravel clearing between the barn and the house, the hub of open space that all chore-goers must pass through. Now I saw one of the sisters, but I couldn't tell which one. She was walking through the mud where the cows enter and leave the barn, and I called out and gave a raised arm.

Soon the three of us were together. We stayed outside talking for just a few minutes, and should have stayed out longer. Their dad and mom were down at the State Fair - a surprise gift of leisure from their children - and the three of us had the opening of the night to ourselves; three young friends in the setting sun, on a homeplace of hard work and sweat.

There are a number of things I remember about that place, their farm, but one of them is singular: the cross on the barn door.

Like most barns, theirs is painted red. The main door, between the milk shed and the barn proper, is white. Centered at head level is a wire cross, well-proportioned and slightly curved. It is thick with several lengths of wire, and while not perfectly symmetrical or aligned, it bears marks of honest and long work, and is beautiful for its simple shape and expression of care.

It is there every time you walk in. One must always face it before passing through.
