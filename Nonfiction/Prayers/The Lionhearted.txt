I belong with the Lionhearted.

The die has been cast, the decision has been made;
I have stepped over the line.

I will not look back, let up, slow down, back away, or be still.
My past is redeemed, my present makes sense, and my future is in God's hands.

I am finished with low-living, sight-walking, small planning, the bare minimum, smooth knees, colorless dreams, tamed visions, trivial talking, frivolous living, selfish giving, and dwarfed goals.

I no longer need preeminence, prosperity, position, promotions, applause, or popularity.

I do not have to be regarded as right, the first, the best, or be recognized, praised, or rewarded.

I now live by faith; I lean on Christ's presence.

I love with patience, live by prayer, and labor with the power of God's grace.

My face is set, my gait is fast, my goal is Heaven.

My road is narrow, my way is rough, my companions are few, my guide is reliable, and my mission is clear.

I cannot be bought, compromised, detoured, lured away, turned back, deluded, or delayed, and I will not negotiate at the table of the enemy, ponder at the pool of popularity, or meander in the maze of mediocrity.

I will be steady in the face of sacrifice, and prompt in the presence of adversity.

I will not give up, shut up, let up, or slow up;
I will stay up, store up, pray up, and speak up for the cause of Christ.

I must go until He comes, give until I drop, speak out until all know, and work until He stops me.

I am a disciple of Jesus.

When He returns for His own, He will recognize me.
My banner is clear:

I am one of the Lionhearted.

Adapted from a prayer found written in the home of an African pastor martyred for his commitment to Christ some years ago.
