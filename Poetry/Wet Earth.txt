Your feet on wet earth,
as the wind soaks the trees;
the moonlight's been a stranger
since you've gotten up off your knees;
and those who have never suffered
are those that will never know:
what leaving and loss bring
in gold weights to a pure soul.

I started to see
when I started to seek;
May we remove all distractions,
and profit from red-skinned knees.



If you never open
your eyes in the dark,
you will forever
miss the stars.
