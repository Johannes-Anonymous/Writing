Wind-caressed and snowswept;
spoken in wonder, you name awakens hunger
in the caverns of my chest.

With my fiddle-neck rent, and heartstrings bent in wreck,
pure desires burn,
and I am yearning for repair.

I am wandering, stuck-bent homebound,
gently aching south now,
for good memories are anchored in warmer days.

Up stone steps of your hilled home,
my face and name you'll know,
and I wonder if my hopes
- unseen like covered bones -
will bear weight when spoken
or if real luster will be shown
to be mere taunt of fool's gold.
