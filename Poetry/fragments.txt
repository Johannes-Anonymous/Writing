Now I was back, at my apartment,
and could hear only my refrigerator hum
and the floorboards above me creak from my upstairs neighbor;
just shallow sighs from cold machines and familiar strangers.



shallow sighs
familiar strangers



I woke from wish
    to reality
when we wed.



hearts torn like rags
    left to waste;



If I toil and sweat,
    will my hopes
    rise up again?



What comes from above
    first abides within.



Slow dancing under stars,
    and breaking little hearts.



Growing old,
    and filling your heart until
    it's big enough to break.



Trading dreams like kisses,
    your skin soft under moon glow.

Slow dancing under stars,
    as heat finds it way back home;
May moon rising,
    trading kisses beneath its glow.



Do you wait?
Are you filled?
Have you fled from darkness and ugliness to the realm of repair?

I could not fully restrain trial for you,
and I'm learning to dive into hope.

Waves break heavy,
and I want you here:
    not to ease pain,
    but to share joy.




I want you, no less,
    for all the trials in my life,
        for the immersion in struggle.



A black hole within your body;
does anyone ever feel the life go?



Blackest is the cloudless sky,
purified for the dawn.



I can still taste my regrets, made at every single turn;
Fate and I never got along, one of us had to burn.

Questions cut through my mind and leave me in ruins:
You stayed with me through the winter, why'd you go in June?
A deck of fifty-one is left lying on my floor —
You left said we'd meet again, but not through which door.



Dry ash, bare chest, and your hair matted, damp
    — you've been trivialized by compromise.



Now you are tarnished, unsure, unsteady,
    with feet frail
    and a beat behind.



It's time to be honest;
I'm tired of staying clean.



I had whiskey in the morning
because I'm tired of my white teeth;
and every time I look in the mirror
I start feeling like I want to see someone bleed.



Ugliness bears forth,
    and drags face.



I have bad blood,
    hot from swollen tongue,
soaking my teeth.



Do you weep hot tears
    for your brother's empty veins?



White-ice wind
snaps against skin
and whips blue-vein blood
into heat.



Dappled sky at sunrise,
your heart knocking slowly
against my ribs.



We consecrate the day
by sweat, gift, and sacrifice.



Rejection of the mystical and mythical.



My desire no longer lives,
but it has not left my chest.



Look:
Silver bells,
silent on the sleight,
nearly shrouded by the snow.



There's a hidden river in the valley masked by trees
where your name still echoes over living things.



I remain in the open prairie
beneath the dark heavens,
yearning yet,
in stillness and silence.



I have come, now, for a small proposal:
just an evening of your life,
and openness to going deeper, further,
if there leads the light.



Heading westward into the wind
to slow the sinking of the sun.



Ravens
    are no longer
a surprise.



(addressed to One above)
Raise our eyes to raise our spirits;
Into depths yet dark plunge my yearning, moaning heart.



Seven-howl moan
Seven-howl moon



Fears,
    just anchors upon the heart.



Snowfeather.
Winterfeather.
Wintersong.



I expect to see bright blossoms soon,
but I have been expecting such things
for a long time.



I wish for a clearing of the weeds,
a harvest of truth.



I wish for the vines around my heart to be loosened and/or healed,
whose seeds were aimlessly sown decades ago.



Neither the ground, the absent, nor the dead speak,
but yet I have come back to this town — the origin of my origin [my father's hometown].
I have come back to the homes, sidewalks, and fields abandoned by my ancestors.

I wait to receive what should have been given;
I wait like a cold match amidst damp leaves.



Remember snow forts with plywood and two-by-fours?
A Christmas tree from our backyard?
And the neighbor's hill,
perfect for all our sleds?



Beside the dusty grain bins, busted trucks rust —
a scattering of pale and dented shells.
Their headlights are home to sickly mice,
waiting out a dry winter in shattered and cracked glass.



The moon rose, the streetlights glowed, the clocks were stopped;
The air was loaded with silence, and you're down to the rocks;
Your shoes are stained with mud, your word doesn't amount to much;
To the wind, they'll throw what they cannot carry out.

You've dealt with dreams, with pleasure, with pain;
You've taken your cards, we have all done the same;
The difference is not in the silver or the sin;
And it's known: you can close your eyes only once.

Now I'm too old for dreaming, too old for staining glass;
I know what's to lose, and the dice have already been cast;
But you brought back a change we thought we'd never see again;
I pray, there's one more ticket, for the train.

Some would say, they welcomed your years,
For a bet, a laugh, a reason other than tears.
But what have you to bargain, what again may be sweet?
Salvage the bones, lock-up what used to be home.



The habits we've built
    turn into lead weights
upon our chests.



Being blessed means being bloodied.



Days disappear
like sand dispersing
in a stream.



Face the wind with jagged teeth.
(“jagged” applies to either the wind or the teeth)



Dark bones shaking
under fragile skin.

Dark bones shiver
under fragile skin.



Two, now one,
sweet bones of each other's bones.



Time has made trails in my face.



Stars dance
over a pale moonscape.



Rest, ye weary traveler,
    upon the edge of night.



July swelter and hopes unbroken
    bear down like stillborn chains.



Waves break heavy,
and I want you here.



Is it pain enough to quit?
Have you been filled enough to give?

Restless winds inside your head,
dreams better left unsaid;
Do you dare bring it up if you fear bringing it to life?



Killing time before an answer can be lived,
days until you'll take a step again;
You have her number, but do you have her heart?



I thirst for your beauty,
and I wonder how you will change
as we move further in and farther up.



To the heights you are called —
Father's last words
as daylight falls:
“Goodnight, sweet daughter,
and we'll see you in the sunrise.”



We remain young
when gazed upon
by the eyes of love.



Knuckles cracked from the cold,
dripping blood in the snow —
yes, this is music drawn by love's bow.



Dead leaves are pounded into the dirty ground;
She shakes her dress, pulls her ribbons out,
and her tears on his collar turn into stains.

She says, “Scratch out the space between our names.”



I'm going back to the land
that holds the bones of my father.



Freight train wind



Headwind Nebraska
(Overcome)



Can stars re-emerge,
once drowned in the dark?



The moon above our heads,
the fields beyond our arms,



Tapping the stars in the night.



Fellowship
Abundance

Marriage of Love and Truth.

    Maturity
        Purity
            Innocence



My bones ache
to wake at your side.



My bones hum,
still warm from the sunrise.



When our fields were rich,
When our hearts were heavy with hope,



Though it be late of day
    in a land oft covered
    by hard snow and frost



I wonder about the seasons
    turning over and over our earth:
Will we let them lay down dark,
    fresh soil upon our souls?



What will be born
    of the struggle we have long shouldered
    with our nearly-clotted blood?



Who will take up the torch,
and whom do we carry it for?



May the match not be lit
to be quenched
with just a hiss.



When Heaven is drawn from images
of the life you let pass;
Can you face your sins, faults, and weaknesses,
and the good you should've let yourself have?



It seems I was known,
and this I never knew.



Yet, far north, past the front line,
I am told the sun is rising late,
and that falling leaves
are catching its light.

Here, I have seen the sinking sun
paint a single tree in fire.



Let this desire flow from my heart
like a river of wind through the trees.



Hollow-hearted and open to light.



Remember when we talked,
about God, life, and death?
When it begins, how it should end, and what comes next?



The coal hits fire, as the engine heads for death;
The oven burns red, as the metal bleeds the rest;
The foreman shuts his eyes, he knows what comes next.

The thunder rolls heavy, with fury it stamps the ground;
Three dogs are howling, deep inside the town;
The sky, it hums, as it's sinking down.

There's a hollow in the ground, and ten hands on the track;
There's a howl coming closer, and many hands on the track;
There's a darkness on the silver, a glint from which you can't look back.



Resting in heat,
gazing into the liquid heavens above,
watching galaxies pulse like hot-blooded dreams.



The abundant fulfillment
of all our desires.



A yearning, burning, surging desire,
drawing us together to the heights.
