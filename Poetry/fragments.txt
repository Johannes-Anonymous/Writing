Now I was back, at my apartment, and could hear only my refrigerator hum and the floorboards above me creak from my upstairs neighbor; just shallow sighs from cold machines and familiar strangers.



shallow sighs
familiar strangers



I woke from wish
    to reality
    when we wed.




hearts torn like rags
    left to waste;




If I toil and sweat,
    will my hopes
    rise up again?




What comes from above
    first abides within.




Slow dancing under stars,
    and breaking little hearts.




Growing old,
    and filling your heart until
    it's big enough to break.




Trading dreams like kisses,
    your skin soft under moon glow.

Slow dancing under stars,
    as heat finds it way back home;
May moon rising,
    trading kisses beneath its glow.




Do you wait?
Are you filled?
Have you fled from darkness and ugliness to the realm of repair?

I could not fully restrain trial for you,
and I'm learning to dive into hope.

Waves break heavy,
and I want you here:
    not to ease pain,
    but to share joy.





I want you, no less,
    for all the trials in my life,
        for the immersion in struggle.




A black hole within your body;
does anyone ever feel the life go?




Blackest is the cloudless sky,
purified for the dawn.




I can still taste my regrets, made at every single turn;
Fate and I never got along, one of us had to burn.

Questions cut through my mind and leave me in ruins:
You stayed with me through the winter, why'd you go in June?
A deck of fifty-one is left lying on my floor —
You left said we'd meet again, but not through which door.




Dry ash, bare chest, and your hair matted, damp
    — you've been trivialized by compromise.




Now you are tarnished, unsure, unsteady,
    with feet frail
    and a beat behind.




It's time to be honest;
I'm tired of staying clean.




I had whiskey in the morning
because I'm tired of my white teeth;
and every time I look in the mirror
I start feeling like I want to see someone bleed.




Ugliness bears forth,
    and drags face.




I have bad blood,
    hot from swollen tongue,
soaking my teeth.




Do you weep hot tears
    for your brother's empty veins?




White-ice wind
snaps against skin
and whips blue-vein blood
into heat.




Dappled sky at sunrise,
your heart knocking slowly
against my ribs.




Rejection of the mystical and mythical.




My desire no longer lives,
but it has not left my chest.




There's a hidden river in the valley masked by trees
where your name still echoes over living things.




I remain in the open prairie
beneath the dark heavens,
yearning yet,
in stillness and silence.




I have come, now, for a small proposal:
just an evening of your life,
and openness to going deeper, further,
if there leads the light.




Heading westward into the wind
to slow the sinking of the sun.




Ravens
    are no longer
a surprise.




(addressed to One above)
Raise our eyes to raise our spirits;
Into depths yet dark plunge my yearning, moaning heart.




Seven-howl moan
Seven-howl moon




Fears,

    just anchors upon the heart.




Snowfeather.
Winterfeather.




I expect to see bright blossoms soon,
but I have been expecting such things
for a long time.




I wish for a clearing of the weeds,
a harvest of truth.




I wish for the vines around my heart to be loosened and/or healed,
whose seeds were aimlessly sown decades ago.




Neither the ground, the absent, nor the dead speak, but yet I have come back to this town — the origin of my origin [my father's hometown]. I have come back to the homes, sidewalks, and fields abandoned by my ancestors.

I wait to receive what should have been given;
I wait like a cold match amidst damp leaves.




Yet, far north, past the front line,
I am told the sun is rising late,
and that falling leaves
are catching its light.

Here, I have seen the sinking sun
paint a single tree in fire.




Beside the dusty grain bins, busted trucks rust —
a scattering of pale and dented shells.
Their headlights are home to sickly mice,
waiting out a dry winter in shattered and cracked glass.




Remember snow forts with plywood and two-by-fours?
A Christmas tree from our backyard?
And the neighbor's hill,
perfect for all our sleds?




The habits we've built
    turn into lead weights
upon our chests.




Being blessed means being bloodied.




Days disappear
like sand dispersing
in a stream.




Face the wind with jagged teeth.
(“jagged” applies to either the wind or the teeth)




Dark bones shaking
under fragile skin.

Dark bones shiver
under fragile skin.




Two, now one,
sweet bones of each other's bones.




Time has made trails in my face.




Stars dance
over a pale moonscape.




Rest, ye weary traveler,
    upon the edge of night.




July swelter and hopes unbroken
    bear down like stillborn chains.




Waves break heavy,
and I want you here.




Is it pain enough to quit?
Have you been filled enough to give?

Restless winds inside your head,
dreams better left unsaid;
Do you dare bring it up if you fear bringing it to life?




Killing time before an answer can be lived,
days until you'll take a step again;
You have her number, but do you have her heart?
