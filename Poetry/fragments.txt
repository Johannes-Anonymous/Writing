Now I was back at home, my apartment, and hearing only my refrigerator hum and the floorboards above me creak from my neighbor; just shallow sighs from machines and familiar strangers.



shallow sighs
familiar strangers



I woke from wish
    to reality
    when we wed.




hearts torn like rags
    left to waste;




If I toil and sweat
    will my hopes
    rise up again?




What comes from above
    first abides within.




Slow dancing under stars,
    and breaking our little hearts.




Growing old,
    and filling your heart until
    it's big enough to break.




Trading dreams like kisses,
    your skin soft under moon glow.

Slow dancing under stars,
    as heat finds it way back home;
May moon rising,
    trading kisses beneath its glow




I often walk through flowering fields,
    gathering sweetest lilies;
but all of good earth and work
    turns soon to dust,
    carried away by wind.





The glory of grace glows amber, as dim gold behind tarnished glass.

Do you wait?
Are you filled?
Have you fled from darkness and ugliness to the realm of repair?

I could not fully restrain trial for you,
and I'm learning to dive into hope.

Waves break heavy,
and I want you here:
    not to ease pain,
    but to share joy.





I want you, no less,
    for all the trials in my life,
        for the immersion in struggle.




A black hole within your body;
does anyone ever feel the life go?




Blackest is the cloudless sky,
that’s been purified for the dawn




I can still taste my regrets, made at every single turn
Fate and I never got along, one of us had to burn

Questions cut through my mind and leave me in ruins
You stayed with me through the winter, why'd you go in June
a deck of fifty-one is left lying on my floor
You left said we'd meet again, but not through which door





Dry ash, bare chest, and your hair damp
    — trivialized by compromise.



Now you are tarnished, unsure, unsteady,
    with feet frail
    and a beat behind.



It's time to be honest;
I'm tired of staying clean.




I had whiskey in the morning
because I'm tired of my clean teeth;
and every time I look in the mirror
I start feeling like I want to see something bleed.




Ugliness bears forth,
    and drags face.





I have bad blood,
    hot from swollen tongue,
soaking my teeth.





Do you weep hot tears
    for your brother's empty veins?




White-ice wind
snaps against skin
and whips blue-vein blood
into heat.






Dappled sky at sunrise,
your heart knocking slowly
against my ribs.





Rejection of the mystical and myth.





My desire no longer lives,
but it has not left.










The words were like knives across my tongue as they left,
and I didn't realize they were hot and sharp
until they were gone.

Words like
knives across the tongue,
hot and sharp.

Yet, my desires for you remain;
but I have been waiting
— for a word of permission from the dark heavens —
for so long
that they seem dead.



There's a hidden river
in the valley masked by trees
where your name still echoes
over the bones living things.




I remain in the open prairie
beneath the dark heavens,
yearning yet,
in stillness and silence.




I have come, now, for a small proposal:
just an evening of your life,
and openness to going deeper, further,
if there leads the light.




Heading westward into the wind
to slow the sun's sinking.
[ to slow the sinking of the sun ]




Ravens
are no longer
a surprise.




The yet untouched flesh of woman
draws me forth in ache.




Raise our eyes to raise our spirits;
Into depths yet dark plunge my yearning, moaning heart.




Seven-howl moan
Seven-howl moon




Fears: anchors upon the heart.




Snowfeather.
Winterfeather.




I expect to see buds and blossoms soon,
but I have been expecting such things
for a long time.




I wish for a clearing of the weeds,
and a harvest of truth.




I wish for the vines around my heart to be loosened or healed,
whose seeds were aimlessly sown decades ago.




Neither the ground, the absent, nor the dead speak, but yet I have come back to this town — the origin of my origin [my father's hometown]. I have come back to the houses, sidewalks, and fields abandoned by my ancestors.

I returned to receive what originally should have been given,
and I wait like a cold match in a pile of damp leaves.




Yet, far north, past the front line,
I am told the sun is rising late,
and that the fallen leaves
are catching its light.

Here, I have seen the sinking sun
paint a single tree in fire.




Beside the dusty grain bins, busted trucks rust —
a scattering of pale and dented shells.
The headlights are home to sickly mice,
waiting out a dry winter in the cracked glass.




Remember snow forts with plywood and two-by-fours?
A Christmas tree from our backyard?
And the neighbor's hill,
perfect for all our sleds?




The habits we've built
turn into lead weights
upon our chests.




Being blessed means being bloodied.




Days disappear
like sand dispersing
in a stream.




Face the wind with jagged teeth.
(“jagged teeth” applies to the wind)




Dark bones
under fragile skin.
