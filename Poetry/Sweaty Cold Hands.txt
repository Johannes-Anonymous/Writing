    "TICK"s are left-aligned;
    "TOCK"s are right-aligned;
    the rest is center-aligned;
    "TICK"s and "TOCK"s begin farther out and work themselves closer to the center with each line at a constant rate.
    Main text with multiple words per line: the spacing between words starts noticeably larger than normal, and gets smaller at a constant rate: the last line should have noticeablely smaller-than-usual spacing between the words,
    and "under fumbling" should have approximately normal spacing between the words.
