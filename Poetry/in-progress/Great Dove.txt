Within love,
and held with truth,
I bear your vision joyfully,
and rest, internally content.

This evening grows with life,
and hearts blossom under the falling sun.

Chests are crossed with charcoal,
and what is burned is that
    which has passed.

I remember Saturdays
    before you,
    good and filled,
        but not fertile like this.

I remember laying with back
    to ground
    and heart to earth,
hearing echoes of ancestors
    through my [shivering][shaking][quivering] bones;
from the rumble of soil,
    so deep to be only felt,
to the surface of our skin,
    the Great Dove's grace impels
    us to newness,
        and stretches our resistance.
