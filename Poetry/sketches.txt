familiar strangers
shallow sighs

Now I was back at home, my apartment, and hearing only my refrigerator hum and the floorboards above me creak from my neighbors; just shallow sighs from appliances and familiar strangers.





I woke from wish
    to reality
    when we wed.




hearts torn like rags
    left to waste;




If I toil and sweat
    will my hopes
    rise up again?




What comes from above
    first abides within.




Slow dancing under stars,
    and breaking our little hearts.




Growing old,
    and filling your heart until
    it's big enough to break.




Trading dreams like kisses,
    your skin soft under moon glow.

Slow dancing under stars,
    as heat finds it way back home;
May moon rising,
    trading kisses beneath its glow




I often walk through flowering fields,
    gathering sweetest lillies;
but all of good earth and hearth
    turns soon to dust,
    carried away by wind.





The glory of grace glows amber, as dim gold behind tarnished glass.

Do you wait?
Are you filled?
Have you fled from darkness and ugliness to the realm of repair?

I could not fully restrain trial for you,
and I'm learning to dive into hope.

Waves break heavy,
and I want you here:
    not to ease pain,
    but to share joy.





I want you, no less,
    for all the trials in my life,
        for the immersion in struggle.




A black hole within your body;
does anyone ever feel the life go?




Blackest is the cloudless sky,
thatâ€™s been purified for the dawn




I can still taste my regrets, made at every single turn
Fate and I never got along, one of us had to burn

Questions cut through my mind and leave me in ruins
You stayed with me through the winter, why'd you go in June
a deck of fifty-one is left lying on my floor
You left said we'd meet again, but not through which door




It's time to be honest;
I'm tired of staying clean.




Ugliness bears forth,
    and drags face.
