familiar strangers
shallow sighs

Now I was back at home, my apartment, and hearing only my refridgerator hum and the floorboards above me creak from my neighbors; just shallow sighs from appliances and familiar strangers.





hearts torn like rags
    left to waste;





I often walk through flowering fields,
    gathering sweetest lillies;
but all of good earth and hearth
    turns soon to dust,
    carried away by wind.





The glory of grace glows amber, as dim gold behind tarnished glass.

Do you wait?
Are you filled?
Have you fled from darkness and ugliness to the realm of repair?

I could not fully restrain trial for you,
and I'm learning to dive into hope.

Waves break heavy,
and I want you here:
    not to ease pain,
    but to share joy.
