Now I was back at home, my apartment, and hearing only my refrigerator hum and the floorboards above me creak from my neighbor; just shallow sighs from machines and familiar strangers.



shallow sighs
familiar strangers



I woke from wish
    to reality
    when we wed.




hearts torn like rags
    left to waste;




If I toil and sweat
    will my hopes
    rise up again?




What comes from above
    first abides within.




Slow dancing under stars,
    and breaking our little hearts.




Growing old,
    and filling your heart until
    it's big enough to break.




Trading dreams like kisses,
    your skin soft under moon glow.

Slow dancing under stars,
    as heat finds it way back home;
May moon rising,
    trading kisses beneath its glow




I often walk through flowering fields,
    gathering sweetest lilies;
but all of good earth and work
    turns soon to dust,
    carried away by wind.





The glory of grace glows amber, as dim gold behind tarnished glass.

Do you wait?
Are you filled?
Have you fled from darkness and ugliness to the realm of repair?

I could not fully restrain trial for you,
and I'm learning to dive into hope.

Waves break heavy,
and I want you here:
    not to ease pain,
    but to share joy.





I want you, no less,
    for all the trials in my life,
        for the immersion in struggle.




A black hole within your body;
does anyone ever feel the life go?




Blackest is the cloudless sky,
that’s been purified for the dawn




I can still taste my regrets, made at every single turn
Fate and I never got along, one of us had to burn

Questions cut through my mind and leave me in ruins
You stayed with me through the winter, why'd you go in June
a deck of fifty-one is left lying on my floor
You left said we'd meet again, but not through which door




It's time to be honest;
I'm tired of staying clean.




Ugliness bears forth,
    and drags face.





Dry ash, bare chest, and your hair damp
    — trivialized by compromise.

Now you are tarnished, unsure, unsteady,
    with feet frail
    and a beat behind.




Ravens
are no longer
a surprise.




I have bad blood,
    hot from swollen tongue,
soaking my teeth.





Do you weep hot tears
    for your brother's empty veins?




White-ice wind
snaps against skin
and whips blue-vein blood
into heat.






Dappled sky at sunrise,
your heart knocking slowly
against my ribs.





Rejection of the mystical and myth.





My desire no longer lives,
but it has not left.










The words were like knives across my tongue as they left,
and I didn't realize they were hot and sharp
until they were gone.

Words like
knives across the tongue,
hot and sharp.

Yet, my desires for you remain;
but I have been waiting
— for a word of permission from the dark heavens —
for so long
that they seem dead.



There's a hidden river
in the valley masked by trees
where your name still echoes
over living things.

I remain in the open prairie
beneath the dark heavens,
yearning yet,
in stillness and silence.




I have come, now, for a small proposal:
just an evening of your life,
and openness to going deeper, further,
if there leads the light.
