Plans my father made
    lie before me
    wrapped in fear
    and covered by dust.

I have closets and alleyways
    packed in the crevices of my heart;
    often moaning with blood,
    I live in the stench of fear.

I do not recognize sins
    I have grown into
    until I taste bad blood
    from my swollen tongue.

I hope you may ease into life
    and rest gently
    at its end.
