# Purity

Your damp feet rest on wet earth,
as the wind soaks the trees;
Moonlight's been a stranger
since you've risen from your knees.

So draw in cold breath,
and remember when it was that you began to see:
when you were aching, seeking, digging into grace â€”
always skinning your knees.

So enter again,
and move past wondrous sunrise warmth;
you must open your eyes, fully,
to see stars in the dark.

And fear not strange suffering,
for only through such can you know:
the gold that loss and leaving bring,
the good weight of a purified soul.
