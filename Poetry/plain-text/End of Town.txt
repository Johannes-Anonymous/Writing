Dad bought me a guitar when I was fourteen,
and with it gave me my dreams.
I am often surprised when looking back on those years,
because their ways are so strange now.

It used to feel like there was some good
above and beyond me, waiting to be grown into.
Now I am covered by clouds silent, without wind or rain.

So I often walk to the town's edge,
where most of the roads turn into dirt and dust.
The few sidewalks we have end here,
in useless and unwanted lines.

I think about walking further,
past the city sign and into the fields.

I doubt I would return.
