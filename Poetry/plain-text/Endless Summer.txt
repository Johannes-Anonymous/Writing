Yearning for wedding bells,
stuck in an endless summer,
heat waves cresting,
but never arising are their falls.

On your back in bed,
fever of one-oh-three,
and sounds from your sister's white-dress jubilation
rise and your crumple your sheets —
can you wait anymore,
can you take another sidekick day?

Invitations come,
purple bows and lace,
some have a "plus one",
and your body keeps saying,
"It's getting late", "You'll be a dead-end in history"

But to friends you're a mystery
when all you know is attentive listening;
the moments come,
the moments leave for you to speak.

You will write it down,
in ink you'll drown —
happiness mocking you
from graffiti'ed and empty sheets.

And all the good stories you've written
are only dreams and wishes;
a plan half-given is all
you are open to receive.

Fortune and fate draw nearer,
a touch harder and a little more certain
every day.
