I lived for one entire summer
On a single-speed bike;
My friends were the coffee-ground kids,
Our territory was moonlight.

We had this plan, a script at night,
To take our Huffy's, and search for our lives all around;
But you find out how dead everything is
When ten minutes takes you to both sides of town.

Through the fairgrounds park, past the dust arcade,
To the trains, their tracks split in the dark…

We'd run to the top of the closed granary,
The highest point, in this half of the state —
Until the demolition crew followed us,
and we learned nothing we had could be saved.
-
just when you thought there were some things
that could never be taken away.

And when your command of the darkness slides from your tongue,
And nothing you do is ever enough;
There's a hunger you feel, and a cry you can't quite hear,
Just a black fate deep in your gut.

If you've caught us riding, with death in our eyes,
We're headed towards that old sacred spot —
To stand in line, and wait for our turn (where nothing lives, and the
only thing complete)(to lean on memories of our dreams, staring at)
Beside a bulldozer in a bare parking (wasted) lot.
