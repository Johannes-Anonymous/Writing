# A Pale Twinge

I have seen the stars
turn dull and flat before sinking,
and felt the heavens chill
and become black.

Somehow, here in our land,
the massive freight trains
no longer rumble or make a sound,
while they used to howl over our streets.

And every night for a year,
I have sat on my porch
and felt the heat slowly escape;
and each morning it returns,

while I have seen our faces —
like weathered stone —
turn hard and chiseled
toward neighbor and friend.

There is a pale twinge
in the birds and air
that came down
from the sky.
