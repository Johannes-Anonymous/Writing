Did you give me a name before my birth?

Why did no more follow —
    was I not worth the pain?

Would you give me back so you could return
    to comfort, and ease,
    and “love” without sacrifice?

Mother, Father,
    Do you know why?

    Did you truly see each other,
    or did you only see yourselves?

Mom, Dad,

    Why am I?
