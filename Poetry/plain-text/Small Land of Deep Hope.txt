These nights are precious.
These are days of which we will sing.

These are warm-blooded ghost evenings,
    of shadow trees and sunken lanes,
    of quiet leaves and walnut-buried homes.

From here spring moments
    in which memories are instantly born,
    and friendships immediately forged.

This is where and when we learn to sing
    with our capillaries pulsing,
    full of bright-edged spirit;
        our lungs drenched in gold breath.

This is where we shall labor,
    and where our bones will rest
    until we are clean.

This little earth is ours:
    a small land
    of deep hope.
