Ten-hour shifts, filling up my summer with sweat:
O, I learned a lot.

Do you know the sound of exhaustion, borne before the work begins?
I remember counting days and sleeping in despair.

Do you know the fear of oncoming failure, thick like a fog?
I have inhaled it, and I remember all the dates.

Do you know what death looks like on a living face?
I have seen it, and I can add the names.


I have learned where the barely-living and the lonely stand before their shifts,
and I have seen them leave the floor unswept at night's end,
shuffling toward the door with bowing backs.


I have learned the hopeless weight of my lunchbox, both empty and full,
in my small and calloused hands,
and I have grown to ignore the rain on my walk home.


I have stood naked
before my death.
