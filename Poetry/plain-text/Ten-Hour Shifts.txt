Ten-hour shifts, filling my summer up with sweat:
Oh, I learned a lot.

Do you know the sound of exhaustion, borne before work even begins?
I remember counting remaining days and sleeping in despair.

Do you know the fear of oncoming failure, thick like a fog?
I have tasted it, and I remember dates.

Do you know what death looks like on a living face?
I have seen it, and I can give names.


I have learned where the lonely stand before their shift,
and that no one sticks around at its end.


I know the weight of my lunchbox, both empty and stuffed, in my small hands,
and I have grown to ignore the rain on my walk home.


I have stood naked
before my death.
