# When Our Fields Were Rich

When our fields were rich,
When our hearts were heavy with hope,
When sunlight dripped like honey from the comb
    upon our summer porches,

We married each other
and you followed me
away from your parent's house,
and beneath white sheets in the evening breeze
I bestowed motherhood upon you.

As the weeks and rains passed before the harvest,
our daughter grew in the soft darkness
of your sweet garden.

But like a star suddenly swallowed,
her life vanished â€”
a black hope opened within your body,
and your womb delivered
only blood and bones.

We gave our daughter's remains
back to the black soil,
just as the first frost set in.
Her name, too, went into the ground,
unspoken and unknown.

Abandoning your heart
to the anchor of her absence,
you sank into a black winter of rejection,
and sought redemption in the coals
of another man's hearth.

As the leaves returned to the trees,
you again were filled with life.
But when this child came forth with thirsty cries
on a moonless and frigid night,
I saw her face, I saw yours,
and I knew: she was not mine.

So I returned to our bedroom,
tore off our white linen sheets,
and dragged our mattress into the street.
Your white dress I threw on top.

All of it I set aflame,
sending back to the black sky
everything you had thrown away.
My hot breath rose with the filthy smoke
into the dagger-sharp winter air.

The ashes choked our garden,
and it has not been cleansed
by your tears.
