I have seen the stars
turn dull and flat before sinking,
and felt the heavens chill
and become black.

Somehow, here in our land,
the hard and massive freight trains
no longer make a rumble or sound,
while they used to howl through town.


And every night for a year
I have sat on my porch
and felt the heat gradually escape;
and each morning it returns,

while I have seen our faces
like weathered stone
turn hard and chiseled
toward neighbor and friend.

There is a blue twinge
in the air and birds
that descended
from the sky.


Far north, past the frost line,
I am told the sun is rising late,
and that the fallen leaves
are catching its light.

Here, I have seen the sinking sun
paint a single tree in fire;

and I know I am late to life.
