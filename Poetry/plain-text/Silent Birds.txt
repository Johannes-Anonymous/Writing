I still gaze
    into the emerging stars
    at dusk.

I used to wait
    (do I still wish?)
    for your womanly voice
    as I began my walks home.

I no longer laugh among our friends,
    but with my hands clasped,
    just wait for
    the end.

And the sight of silent birds
    with wide black wings
    is no longer unwelcome,
    nor a surprise.

My skies are filled,
    while my cupboards at home
    remain bare.
