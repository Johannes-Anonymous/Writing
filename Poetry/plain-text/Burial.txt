# Burial

Your body, in church one more time,
is surrounded by your friends, many new to our eyes;
would we have come together apart from your death?

Your casket comes forward with latches finally taut,
and catches colored sunlight, steps from baptism's font;
like the stone saints, you're alive in love, but cold to our touch.

Our cars snake through town and around the graves;
your plot is fresh: no granite, no name.
We take turns shoveling earth,
    our muscles singing hymns,
        giving praise.
