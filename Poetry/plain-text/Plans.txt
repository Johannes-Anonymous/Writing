Plans my father made
    lie before me,
wrapped in fear
    and covered in dust.

They speak my name.

Yet, I have made my own choices,
    and much rests in the light.

But I do not know many of my sins
    until I taste bad blood
    from my swollen tongue.

May you, friend,
    move ahead with clear sight.
May you ease into life
    and rest gently
    at its end.
