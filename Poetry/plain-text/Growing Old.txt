# Growing Old

Winter bears heavily
upon bowed trees
over covered grass.

Spring is a distant memory,
something I hardly hope
will again come to pass.

But there is still a bird,
    or three,
warbling among the stubborn leaves;
a sort of promise or sign
that the night of cold
is meant to subside.

…

I follow my own footprints,
packed down through the woods,
and I come out to another bare field,
wide and white, whether under cloud or sun.

There is a kettle waiting to be warmed on the stove,
and there are letters to be written
to those away from home.
My feet again turn cold;
I must face back home,
my feet begin to move.

I have seen more than I remember,
and held more than I may keep.
I am small, brittle, and weak again,
and there is a final filling of my heart that must come
before I may leave.
