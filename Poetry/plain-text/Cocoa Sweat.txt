Poverty of man
    turns rich soil dark,
    and I bake in earthly labor,
        turning cocoa with sweat â€”
        trial stuck, pasted,
            compressed against skin.
My days peel off,
    tender to your glance.

Dear, good friend,
    woman become sister,
        I pine for hope,
        and rest beside you.

Salt the night
    with your kiss,
    and draw moonglow close
        with touch of feather-heart.
