# Dwarves of the North

Alone in the cold,
save for the seldom trader brave.
Why they came and stayed is unknown,
for their lore remains their own.

Their treasures glow in firelit halls,
their chanties resound down tunnels a thousand fathom long;
Many stories are sung on faraway lands
of the sparkling caverns, magnificent and grand.

Pelts, pearls, furs, and tusks:
these are their goods of saltwater musk;
from their glacial homes they plumb
the depths of the dark arctic sea.

Their hands are rough, worn with labor,
and their rugged loyalty never wavers.
Their fiery tempers are short,
with many beards a century long.

While frozen ages run their course,
    the dwarves continue their carving art with constant force:
Though the days may come when the waters rise,
    the moment of an unceasing tide,
it seems certain that they will endure,
    for their hearts are strong, their persistence sure.

Regardless of challenge, they shall carry forth,
    the stout, smelly, and strong
        Dwarves of the North.
