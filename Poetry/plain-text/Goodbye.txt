# “Goodbye”

Father,

Thank you for life.

Thank you for dreams,
for courage and hope,
and for my worn-in baseball and mitt,
and for all our hours together in the backyard.
Remember me catching pop flies better than anyone else's kid?

Thank you for your loyalty,
for choosing Mom as my mother,
and for all the hot meals after the long toils of your day,
and those rides to school every cold morning.

Always, since I was fifteen,
I think of you when I hear Bob Dylan sing.
And when someone mentions one of your favorite old movies,
it's like I'm back in the family room again,
close with you on a cozy Sunday afternoon.

But now the leaves above are spent,
your grass-stained shoes are retired
— remember teaching me to care for our lawn and our neighbors? —
and my kids are running up to me on the sidewalk.


A decade ago, you took me to the big downtown in our search for my next favorite guitar,
and just a few seasons past Mom and I were helping you pick out a headstone and grave.

This time — any time — is too soon and short.

Thank you for being here.
