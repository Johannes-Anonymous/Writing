# Enter In, Friend

Here, our stories begin before our births,
Here, we learn bird songs with our first words,
Here, there's always room on a mother's warm lap.



The seasons we know just by our weather,
    the longer shadows on the river,
    and new colors in the heather.
Calendars on paper?
    Not even for keeping records.

Our mortician and midwives always keep busy —
    church bells sing, endlessly ringing;
    our days are aging well, like wine.

Every neighborhood is claimed —
    sidewalks re-marked with child's chalk after each rain.
Yet our front doors swing freely:
    the only boundaries are fields of grain.



So enter in, and welcome to town:
    on a worn kitchen counter lay your elbows down.
Come, share your neighbor's joy.
