# Woman (Home)

Woman,

    I desire,

To build you a brick house
with wide wooden steps
coming up from the lawn,

To lean a broom on the front porch
and let friends gather
like leaves.

We'll bunch them around bonfires
on crisp autumn nights,
and serenade the stars
with stories that rise like sparks.

Little ones will rustle about
below the soft moon
before being swept by sleep
into their mama's gentle arms.

You and I will wake together
on dewy mornings of robin blue-egg sky,
and waltz into our kitchen white with sun,
the drapes dancing before windows open wide.

We'll croon our favorite tunes,
flip the flapjacks and skim off the cream,
and the aromas and harmonies
will shake and draw our children down from sleep.

They'll tumble in a jumble together,
jostling paper plates to gleefully compete
in setting the table happily, messily,
especially the youngest three.

In the winter we'll build snow forts
with plywood and two-by-fours,
and our favorite Christmas trees
will be those from our backyard.

We'll name all the goslings in spring,
the kids will play hop-scotch and kickball down the street,
and we'll repair their busted bikes
and kiss all their bruised knees.

Woman,

    These are my desires,

and I will build you a brick house
on a strong foundation of stone
if you join me, for only you
would make it a beautiful home.
