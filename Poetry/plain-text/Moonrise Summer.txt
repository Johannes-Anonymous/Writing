# Moonrise Summer

Stars pop out
    above moonrise,
and I lay back,
    on grass
    in July heat;
        arms released,
        spread in surrender.

The clouds of ravens
    spread with wonder over sunrise;
wings of summer
    beat mystic joy
    into my trembling heart,
        weak with wonder.
