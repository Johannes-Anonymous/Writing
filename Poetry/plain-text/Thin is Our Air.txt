Thin is our air,
    and pale the sky.

I stand on front stoop,
    tongue cleaved to flesh,
    and shiver softly
        with hollow head.

Friend,
    If the sun returns hot
    to crash in dry tempest,
        know that I have left early,
            with only dust behind.

    For though I am a mere pilgrim
    to these streets,
        all is familiar:

I know the decay of man
    steeped in wealth,
and the blessed scent
    of dark soil turned rich;

    I have heard the screaming void
        of raped autumn nights,
    and the quiet hope
        of gentle open evenings;

    I have felt the heat
        of crackling wreckage,
    and the soft bed of prairie
        wet with evening dew;

    I know the ends of our idols
        and the joy of their burials.

    So if wind quits
    and earth turns bare and burned,
        you can walk by my door
            without a knock
        and follow on the hard trail
            from cement to stone and dirt.

    Later, if by ditch
    you find me,
        rouse me without restraint;
            for my dreams I have woken into,
                and I know our justice is late.
