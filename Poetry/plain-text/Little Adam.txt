# Little Adam

I was four.
My toy school bus was yellow,
and I could wrap my hand around it.
Its little red STOP sign swiveled
on a beautiful, delicate white hinge.

In the hallway, on the floor,
    just outside my bedroom,
I held it with love,
admiring its smooth, flawless paint.

Then,
I knew the idea
of running it into the wall.

And I pictured what would happen,
that its beautiful, delicate red STOP sign
    would break,
and I did not want this.

It made me sad,
to think about it.

Yet this is what I chose,
and I smashed
the tiny, delicate yellow school bus into the wall,
nearly losing control,
and then I stopped.

I looked down
at the tiny, delicate yellow school bus in my hands,
its yellow chipped paint,
its broken red STOP sign on the floor,
its sheared, delicate white hingeâ€¦


I still cry.


My school bus is broken,

and so am I.
