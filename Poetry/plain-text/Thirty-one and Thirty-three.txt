Thirty-one and thirty-three,
with way more kids than realized dreams:
did you imagine we'd be running barefoot
and climbing trees?

We're still too poor for television,
but now I know we're richer for it:
we spent the summer playing outside,
and again, this year, the house is staying white.

The front steps bear ten years of footprints:
can you feel the boards bending, wearing thin?
The house is being worn out,
our home is being worn in.

And every ball and glove is marked with sweat stains,
practically etched with each kid's name.
Remember pop flies in late July
soaring, catching sunlight?

Or snow forts with plywood and two-by-fours?
A Christmas tree from our backyard?
And the neighbor's hill,
perfect for all our sleds?

Tonight, Mama, your dress is fragrant
as Margaret dances on the pavement:
she wanted to try it on,
she wanted to try it on outside.

“Oh, Frank!” she calls,
as she waltzes back through the halls:
she's dreaming of the night
Prince Charming will carry her back inside.

And in the kitchen the tea kettle is singing;
on your skin, sunlight from stained glass is twinkling;
we laugh, the screen door swinging,

and give a twirl and rock-step on the porch
like two sparks rising from a torch —
our evening is young and begging
to be filled with life.
