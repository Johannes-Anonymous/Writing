# Lonely Mother

Just me and the kids,
    their father is gone;
Does he even remember my name?

I let him love me
    just for my face;
Now my flesh, my heart,
    bear the marks of being stretched,
    from their bodies,
        to my grave.

Many summers and sunburns ago,
    that July moon under which we met:
I still feel the punch of his cologne,
    how he brushed my skin;
and when he spoke
    I began to sweat.

Mama says I should have known,
    and it hurts to know she's right;
Our first date, he's forty minutes late,
    the V8 rumbling slowly down the block;
but the black paint gleamed,
    the chrome was glistening,
    spotless from the wash.

So long ago,
    that sweltering night,
    his leather jacket stiff as we met;
I was walking past the five-and-dime,
    groceries in bags,
        he was dangling a fresh cigarette.

I should have known
    from Mama's glance,
    from her silent, watering eyes;
he never kissed my hand,
    or asked me to dance,
        but knew all the words
            of a perfect gentleman.
