# Pre-Launch, Post-Sunset

I plant myself on my concrete steps.

I stare straight up.

My horizon is my roofline,

My sky is filled with trees,

And straight ahead is the endless depth of stars.



My bare feet haven't felt the earth for a week.

Now I wish to leave it forever,

Falling straight up,

And dissolving like smoke.
