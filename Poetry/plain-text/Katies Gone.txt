# Katie's Gone

I remember the days
after you were suddenly gone;
even in the mornings,
a darkness filled the halls;
and never were the class bells so loud.

Just the week before
we were cutting class,
catching rays by the lake,
riding our senior year
like the crest of a wave:

sharing cold beers at dusk,
lawn chairs set, feet kicked up,
chillaxin' in the back of your brother's pick truck;
soaking in the sunset
where the gravel meets the grain.

You wore my name
for the homecoming game,
and in the morning
— all sunshine and waves —
we shared a backseat,
royalty in the next day's parade.

It was the great autumn
of bonfires and friends
— but like Halley's Comet,
never to be seen in our lifetimes again.

We found your car by the dam,
but there were no footprints around,
no signs in the sand;
just the Ford and the river,
rumbling on without a word.

We spent days searching around,
combing the fields, setting a watch
on every riverbank in town;
I watched your face go up
on every store's window downtown.

And what did our friends say?
No one had a clue why you
might want to go away
— your life was fresh and waiting,
like an ink-thirty, nearly-empty page.

So October, then November came and waned,
our souls soaked with sorrow;
and even the moon seemed weary,
too heavy, too tired to rise.
Our nights were dim,
our roaring fires of hope
sputtering into embers barely alive.

Even my bright memories lost color
as wet leaves choked the gutters;
it stings, but thank goodness I still remember
the last time I looked into your eyes.

What galaxies above
could ever substitute for the glory
of you sticking around
for the rest of your story?

I don't dream in my sleep
— not since being emptied that week —
and for your leaving,
I can't fathom a reason;

Ever since we were ten,
to me, you were forever worth keeping.
