# Katie's Gone

I remember the days
after you were suddenly gone;
even in the mornings,
a darkness filled the school halls;
and never were the class bells so loud.

Just the week before
we were cutting class,
catching rays by the lake,
and soaking up sunsets
where the gravel meets the grain:

Sharing cold beers at dusk,
lawn chairs set, feet kicked up,
hanging in the back of your brother's pickup truck.

You wore my name
for the homecoming game,
and we were royalty in the next day's parade,
riding our senior year like the crest of a wave.

It was the great autumn
of bonfires and friends
— but, like Halley's Comet,
I don't think we'll see it or you again;
you just vanished, like a radio cut out —
your music no longer played.

We found your car by the dam,
but there were no footprints around,
no signs in the sand;
just the Ford and the river,
rumbling on without a word.

We spent days searching around,
combing the fields, setting a watch
on every riverbank in town;
I saw your face go up
on every store's window downtown.

October, then November came and waned;
no one had a clue why you
might want to go away
— your life was fresh and waiting,
like an ink-thirsty page.

As our memories lost their color,
the wet leaves choked the gutters,
and our roaring fires of hope
sputtered into embers barely alive.

Yet I still can touch that stellar night,
the last time I looked into your twinkling eyes;
but now the moon seems too heavy,
too weary to rise.

Oh, what galaxies above
could ever substitute for your glory
and your kind of love?
What stars in the dark
could ever make up for your story?

No more do I dream in my sleep
— not since being nearly emptied that week —
and for your leaving,
I can't fathom a reason;

Ever since we were ten, I knew:
you were forever worth keeping.
