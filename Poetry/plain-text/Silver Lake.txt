[left-aligned]
Bright breeze over silver lake
and pure hope through your voice;
air as clear glass before me
and above us, massive sun sinking;


[center-aligned]
Enfold me
until I am known
and purged of impurity, doubt;
until I have harvested
all potential within;
until my heart
is full and hot
and oversaturated
and flowing over

back

for you
.
