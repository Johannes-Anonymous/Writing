# Dad (After Your Funeral)

Your sandals I've become familiar with,
even after having them for just a week.
Your bike squeaks when I pump the brakes;
I'm not sure if I'll keep it.

Are you above, within, around me?
How is it that I am so sure of your hearing?
I wasn't taught this,
but I know it, and it's alive in my bones.

At the auction, I saw your housecleaner.
She mentioned your long goodbye before your final winter trip west:
after the hug you gave her, she didn't expect you to return.

And I wonder about your old neighbors, if they're expecting anything.
I know tools and tips were shared among all of you freely,
but were there any sort of debts left unpaid?

As for me, I'm still not used to seeing the sunrise from your living room
without smelling your cinnamon pancakes and splattering bacon,
and I'm still waiting for you to call me to table.
