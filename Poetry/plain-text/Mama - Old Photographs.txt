# Mama (Old Photographs)

Mama,

    Grandpa gave me some old photographs of you.
    In them you are young,
    and more beautiful than I've known.

    The ones with your parents, our ancestors, surprised me:
    their clothes are smooth, with polished buttons,
    and no one is yet worn or dusty from the fields.

    Near the end of this stack of photos
    you are a child, standing in a white dress â€”
    it is your First Communion.
    After that, you are fifteen, smiling,
    wearing your home team's colors and glowing,
    blossoming in the full years of youth.


I wish you would come back.
