# Old, Going Home

We used to see a smile in the sunset,
and feel a playful tug in the cold.
You and I treasured the sharp chill and sparkling air of our town,
and the crackling, dancing embers of the fire.

Now our bones ache in the autumn,
and we barely make it
south enough fast enough.

The kids are grown,
scattered across the states;
without them, breakfast feels slow.
Sometimes, I forget they've left,
and crack too many eggs.

When you smile at me from across the table,
I feel our youth return,
like a warm breath rekindling darkened coals.

From the rocking chair, at dusk,
I listen to the long freight trains grow louder,
and then fade,
and watch them shrink over the horizon.

The clock strikes nine, ten, then more,
and I start longing
to return
to some place I have never been.

Every morning has been a gift,
and lately,
a surprise.
