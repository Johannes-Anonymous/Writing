# Loose Change

Just me and the kid,
    her daddy is gone;
Does he even remember my name?

I let him love me
    just for my face;
Now my flesh, my heart,
    bear the marks of being stretched
    from their bodies
        to my grave.

Many summers and sunburns ago,
    that July moon under which we met:
I still feel the punch of his cologne,
    how he brushed my skin;
and when he spoke
    I began to sweat.

Mama says I should have known,
    and it hurts to know she's right;
Our first date, he's forty minutes late,
    the V8 rumbling slowly down the block;
but that black paint gleamed,
    the chrome was glistening,
    spotless from the wash.

The weeks were quick
    before I moved in,
my heart fluttering
    when he said I was his;
But he was gone by the time
    the baby arrived,
and I was left,
    alone
    with our daughter's hunger and cries.

And he never asked about her name,
    only sent a few checks,
    crumpled and stained.
It was clear â€”
    we were nothing
        but his life's loose change.

So long ago,
    that sweltering first night,
        his leather jacket stiff as we met;
I was walking past the five-and-dime,
    groceries in bags,
        he was dangling a fresh cigarette.

I should have known
    from Mama's glance,
    from her silent, watering eyes;
he never kissed my hand,
    or asked me to dance,
        but always used all the words
            of a perfect gentleman.
