When colors fail
    to turn in the autumn,
When our habits shrink
    and coalesce;
When the last door out
    requires loss
    of the idols we adore:
I promise we'll be grateful
    if we choose good hope
    this fall;
for the dimmest lamps burn strongest
    when no other lamps
    stand at all.
