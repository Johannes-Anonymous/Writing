My shelves are soaked from the rain.
My books are weeping, and their pages curling.
Will this be the end to all my years?

I threw rocks through my windows,
and fell asleep after falling down, outside,
in some puddle and place
I had never been before.

I do not want to see old photographs,
I do not want memories I cannot deny
of being happy.

I am perfect,
and I do not make mistakes.
