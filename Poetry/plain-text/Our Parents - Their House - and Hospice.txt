Sister,

Friend,

For a while,

Goodbye.


I see the flower in your hair,
the curlers placed with care,
your skin tight against your bones.

Fifty years of growth,
then weeks to dust, your body is smote:
a mountain crumbling hard from its peak.

Just last week you nearly danced over these polished oak floors,
Father gliding your chair through wide-open doors;
now the clock strikes softly, its low weights almost stilled.

The diamond moon rests above your head,
painting with stars silver light upon your bed;
you are silent, awaiting something greater than sleep.

Yet I see your chest swell with life:
a gentle rise, smaller every time;
will you speak again, in these rooms where you were raised?

Us — your brothers, sisters — fill the halls,
scattered, bunched, ragged, like leaves in the fall;
we hold our breaths, trying to trap the wind under our wings.

We brought you home for your last days,
and now make plans to carry your body out for the grave;
one more time you will leave, while Mom and Dad remain.
