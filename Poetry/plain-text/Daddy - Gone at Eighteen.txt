# Daddy (Gone at Eighteen)

Sunrise, July,
    with the last moon dapple in her eyes,
    she sighs,

“Do the rains come
    just to kiss the garden goodbye?
How can they fall
    while the sun still shines?
How do we live with both
    at the same time?
Is every rose that opens
    truly meant to be satisfied?”

“Oh, for a moment, you've got me dying of love —
    I'm feeling young again,
just like I was in my daddy's pickup truck.”

“But why did you wait so long,
    before you changed my name?
Didn't you know that he could be gone
    by the time our kids came?”

“And can you know the weight of my memories,
    the ache of coming back home,
when my father's in the churchyard
    with black dirt over his bones?”

She cries,

“Seventeen years
    feels like such a long time;
and a dozen kids,
    oh, what a wild ride;

But it's still hard to believe
    that death ain't forever,
when it's me and my daddy I grieve.”

“Well, he went up before me,
    up the middle aisle;
I came — white dress — a week later,
    the pews refilled with bittersweet smiles.”

“So tell me,
    since you took back my veil:
Does the other go just one way,
    can you hear his voice,
    what does he say?”

“'Cause thirty-five has been a surprise —
    I didn't know it'd feel this old;
yet I'm still lost, and wanting direction —
    Daddy's gone, and he ain't coming home.”
