# Family Reunions

I do not remember the mornings,
but I can go back to the nights:
    I was in bed,
    ready for sleep,
    and young;
    a boy.



I opened my eyes, and saw my father.
I think he was quiet,
    perhaps asleep.

As I laid still, my blood was warm,
and it moved through my heart.
Its founts were the day's joys,
each amplified by promises of cousins,
    of grandparents,
    of my father's siblings;
        all animated by my father's presence and love.



I was a child then,
and I am learning
    to be young
    again.
