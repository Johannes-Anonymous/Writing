A heart â€”
upon which to rest;
that I may take my own up again,
renewed.

If not,
then a battle against an enemy seen,
to forge my soul
and create of it a weapon against death.

If neither,
then a brother amidst faceless struggle,
another to strain alongside;
he an embodied reminder of some Life beyond us.

For I expect,
until I learn to accept to gaze above and release my grip:
these desert nights will deepen and shed more heat, growing beyond their bounds,
and our silent shadows will lengthen, blanketing more hard, empty ground.
