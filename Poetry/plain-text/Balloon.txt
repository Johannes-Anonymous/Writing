# Balloon

The sun falls below the trees as they park,
the driveway parched from weeks without rain.

A final dinner out together was his idea;
the divorce was hers.

Their only child, a little boy,
anxiously leaves the backseat.
Outside, he hesitates,
not wanting to go into the house.

He tugs on a silver balloon
(plump, with a picture of a lion — his treat from the restaurant)
and watches his dad.

Dad stands motionless at the bottom
of the front steps, his head turned down
and his hands hanging limp.

Mom is at the top turning the key,
oblivious of everyone behind her.
The lock clicks and she walks in,
and the balloon slides from the boy's hands.

He never felt the string slipping.
Suddenly, it's just gone.

For a moment,
all is silent,
and the boy's pupils go wide
and his jaw slackens.

Then he is jumping, grasping and gasping,
calling out and comprehending but disbelieving —
with his raw eyes streaming he sees
his glistening foil disappearing,
shrinking to a point
in the last rays
of summer's
dying
light.

Finally, it's absorbed into the infinite blue.

Then he's quiet again,
hanging his head.
The jagged concrete looks blurry
below his watering eyes.

He didn't know his balloon
could leave so fast,
forever.
