The water tower paint is peeling,
and sometimes we find the lead flakes on our lawns.
No one has been up there since I was born.
No one looks upon our town anymore.

Some days, around noon on the corner lot,
a young man is standing, staring straight up.
He wavers quietly in the wind,
like smoke too listless to rise.

He sees, in the blinding wash of the sun,
that our stars are lost.
Even in the blackness after dusk, they are gone,
and the moon we have forgotten.

All we know is Night,
always rising from the ground,
always swallowing the sun.
