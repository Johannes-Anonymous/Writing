I wake on hardwood floor
with a black ache in my side.

The sun dapples the pine like glowing paint,
and I hear the moaning of ghosts, and birds crying.

Through the busted kitchen window,
a knife-wind cuts against my cheeks;
quickly, my heavy dreams leave me,
    scattered and blown apart by the morning light.
