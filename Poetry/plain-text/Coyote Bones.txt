I awake
    to empty fields,
    and coyote bones
    on my doorstep.
The trees,
    like the dead,
    are silent.

My strength
    weeps out
    from shattered limbs,
and my breaths
    heave
    in flattened gasps,
    dusty and yellow.

I count days,
    and collect poundings
    against my skull,
    bright and sharp.

I thirst
    for dewy consolation,
but my flesh
    is stranger
    to hope.



Stars dance
    across a pale moonscape
and the trails
    of our trials
    thresh through mud and stone,
taking away
    the little and weak bones
    we blindly
    and desperately hold.
