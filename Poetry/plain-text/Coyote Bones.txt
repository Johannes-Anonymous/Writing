I awake to empty fields,
    and coyote bones
    on my doorstep.
The trees,
    like the dead,
    are silent.

My strength
    weeps out
    from shattered limbs,
and my breaths
    heave
    in flattened gasps,
    dusty and yellow.

I count days,
    like poundings
    against my skull,
    bright and sharp.

I thirst
    for dew
    or rain,
but my flesh
    is a stranger
    to hope.
