The dry, sunburnt leaves crackle as they are blown away, and I am ready to be taken with them; standing in the sharp, steady wind, I feel a subtle yearning within me — almost like a free-fall.

I am waiting at Grandma's grave, and Grandpa's is just a few feet to the left. The ground is not yet hard from frost, and it's clear that the grass is done growing until spring.

I am waiting for my father.

The last time we were together, here, we were burying Grandpa's remains. I remember Dad placing us behind most of my cousins, and the scent of snowcrab blossoms soaking the air.

I remember the feel of the soil as I shuffled my feet when the priest invited us grandkids to step up and sprinkle the casket with holy water; and I remember him outwaiting our prolonged, silent hesitation.

I remember going back tot he old house, and watching my father and his siblings split up and share Grandpa's final possessions, now theirs.

I remember coming back home, and in the following months finding the beers we took from Grandpa's basement scattered about the house, nearly-empty bottles keeping company with disarrayed books, food wrappers, and the oily TV remote.

I remember the new silence, stark against the wild jumble of storytelling I heard in our extended family, and I waited — I waited for a renewal of storytelling from Dad; but in silent waiting I received only silence.

So today, alone amidst the splintered acorns and beaten leaves, I wish for Dad to be back at my side, and for us to revisit the places he shared with me in this town when I was small.

I wish to hear the full truths of all those tales I heard years ago, for their memories to come to fulfillment.

I wish to receive satisfaction for all the questions whose seeds were planted decades ago, whose roots now bind around my heart.

As the years have passed since childhood, it feels as if I've been walking deeper into a continually darkening night, while all the streetlamps are being gradually extinguished and the road signs taken away.

My desires and longings remain, and burning within me is the fear that they will continue growing — groaning within me — and never be filled.
