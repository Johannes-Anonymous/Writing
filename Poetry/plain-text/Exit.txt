# Exit

The ground in the town square
no longer freezes,
except after a burial.
We don't bother with headstones anymore.

We count the stars above us,
just pins of light,
dead, without pattern or motion.
They are unworthy of names.

From crooked, rotting porches,
mothers with thin dresses
call children to bed.
The screen doors always slam.

Young women,
whom we once called maidens,
have forgotten their mirrors
and no longer long for new names.

With overgrown limbs and hair,
boys stumble down thistle-filled tracks,
rattling rocks in their empty beers.
They whistle for mutts, and beat them.

Most of our mothers have other kids,
but we haven't heard the words “brother” or “sister”
for many years.

Fathers are not even a memory,
but just a petrified dream.

Infants wail in the black night.
Soon, we hope to forget the sound of crying.
