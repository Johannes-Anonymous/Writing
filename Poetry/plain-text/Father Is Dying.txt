# Father Is Dying

Father is dying.

I count the growing spaces between his breaths,
and weigh the quivering beats of his heart.

Yet,
Father is growing young again;

I see sparks in his eyes
like diamonds on the lake,
and I hear ancient joy in his voice
â€” thunder over tidal waves.

And,
I wait:

Ere his leave, will he look upon his only son
and finally speak his full, true name?
