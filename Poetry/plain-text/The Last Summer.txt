I lived for one entire summer
on a single-speed bike;
my friends were the coffee-ground kids,
our territory was moonlight.

We had this plan, a script at night,
to take our Huffy's and search for our lives all around;
but you find out how dead everything is
when ten minutes takes you to both sides of town.

We'd ride to the abandoned granary,
the highest point in this half of the state;
until the demolition crew followed us,
and we learned that some things can never be saved.

And when the command of the darkness slides from your tongue,
and nothing you do is ever enough;
there's a cry you can't quite hear, a hunger you just can't feel,
a black fate deep in your gut.

So if you catch us riding with death in our eyes,
we're headed to that old sacred spot â€”
to stand in line, and wait our turn,
beside a bulldozer in a bare parking lot.
