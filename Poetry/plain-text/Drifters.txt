# Drifters

As they age —
    slicks grow wide,
    pipes roar loud,
    spoilers rise high above the ground.

As they race —
    skidmarks line the streets,
    NOS exhaust burns our trees,
    big woofers rattle the teeth.

As they rage —
    redlines belt their songs,
    children are dragged inside, slack-jawed in awe,
    “Boys will be boys,”
        their mothers repeat,
            on and on and on . . .
