Wedding bells yearning,
stuck in summer unending;
heat waves are cresting,
but never arising are their falls.

On your back in bed,
fever of one-oh-three,
and sounds from your sister's white-dress jubilation
rise and your crumple your sheets —
can you wait anymore,
can you take another sidekick day?

Invitations come,
purple bows and lace,
some have a “plus one”,
and your body keeps saying,
    “It's getting late”,
    “You'll be a dead-end in history”.

And despite your desires,
to your friends you remain a mystery,
for all you know is a suppressed, vacant listening;
the moments come,
the moments leave for you to speak.

So you write it down,
in ink you drown;
but happiness mocks you
from graffiti'ed and empty sheets:

All the true, good stories you've written
are merely dreams and wishes;
speed bumps are the lonely weekends
on the way to wasted years.
