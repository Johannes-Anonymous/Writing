# Flames

Everyone saw the flames.
The grain elevator had stood for thirty years,
and then in one night,
it went away.

The smoke painted the sky black,
rising and spreading
against the growing thunderclouds.

The first drops of rain fell
after the flames came out,
and then the hail came, hard,
knocking off the exposed metal structure
and shattering onto the street.

The rain picked up,
and the pouring, pounding,
and billowing all came together
until everything was touched
and made fiery red by the sun
as it found a slit below the clouds,
just above the horizon.

We were gathered into a crowd by then,
spilling onto the pavement from
every sidewalk and corner,

and we were silent
as the elevator's frame began to groan
and the whole structure started to tilt.
Amidst a shock of lightning it shrieked
and seemed to throw itself into the ground,
the dust and smoke trailing
like a heavy and slow shadow.

We were covered in dust and ash,
the wash of the red and blue
strobes from the fire trucks
barely punching through the darkness.

For a moment, we stood still.

Then, like an afterthought, came
the evening freight train, howling
and blaring its horn panic-like,
and we realized that the grain elevator
had collapsed over the tracks.

Its headlight illuminated everything with a flash
as it rammed into the elevator's remnants,
the lead engine jackknifing into the air and bursting into flames,
its black metal twisting like a torch over the neighborhood
before smashing into a house below.

Amidst our wails, the trailing cars started spreading
and stacking and skidding out like a tsunami,
downing power lines in electric fireworks
and crushing the police cars like pop cans.

We broke into a stampede,
our yelling and screaming mingling
with the grinding of metal on concrete
in the hot August night.

We fled north to the lake,
away from downtown,
finally stopping at the water's edge
and heaving and panting and fainting in
the violent wind as sand pelted our bodies.

We saw red sparks and flakes
dancing on the whitecaps before us,
and felt the sudden stab of a new chill in the air.

The green clouds above began to
fold in upon themselves,
and the tornado sirens started to squall.



Slowly, I turned back to look at our home,
    and saw pillars of smoke towering
                over our town.



        The flames were everywhere.
