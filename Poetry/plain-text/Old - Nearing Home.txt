# Old, Nearing Home

We used to see a smile in the sunset,
and feel a playful tug in the cold.
You and I treasured the sharp chill and sparkling air of our town,
and the crackling, dancing embers of the fire.

Now our bones ache in the autumn,
and we barely make it
south enough fast enough.

The kids are grown,
scattered across the states,
and without them, breakfast feels slow.
I've started to forget they've left,
and crack too many eggs.

Some days, I also nearly forget your name,
but I always recognize your face;
and when you smile at me from across the table,
I feel our youth return,
like a warm breath rekindling darkened coals.

Under the sun, I take a lot of naps.
When I wake, my tea is always hot
and you're still knitting,
humming a song I knew decades ago.

From the rocking chair, at dusk,
I listen to the long freight trains grow louder,
then fade,
and watch them shrink over the horizon.
Usually I'm too stiff to stand up
without pain or a plan.

The clock strikes nine, ten, then more,
and I start longing to return
to some place I've never seen.

Every morning has been a gift,

    and lately,

a surprise.
