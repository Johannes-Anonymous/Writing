Seven days I have bartered
    for release
    of my imprisoned soul.
Seven years I have borne hate
    of others,
    of their fears
    and their objects of fear.
Six hours I have stood
    against the wall,
    with my life blood
    draining to my feet.

I am not heavier,
    but it's harder
    and harder
    to move.
