Unto home
    I walk with ragged shirt,
    virgin eyes,
    and bruised chest.

My skin is cooled
    by the glowing, westbound wind.

I have kept myself
    and laid my life aside
    to slay our enemies;
I have been allowed
    to take my life up again,
    for you.

When I lay it down
    before your heart and choice,
    it will be final unto death;
so that we may both
    ultimately arise,
        whole,
        healed,
        and one.
