# December, Alone

I've tracked my footprints,
frozen between the trees,
whose tips brush the sun,
whose branches ache in the breeze.

Above, the birdsongs are strained,
while the brush is thin below the snow,
and the drifts are high and slick
in every scattered cove.

And all comes to an end
at a field covered in light,
whose expanse I wish to cross,
whose expanse is wide and white.

And though, tonight, for me alone
will the font door creak,
and the knocking of the rocking chair
be the only voice that speaks,

still I must return,
going back the same way,
leaving the red clouds behind me,
to be followed another day:

There's a kettle to be warmed,
waiting on the stove,
and letters to be written
to those away from home.

So I'll put fresh wood on the coals
and work as the wind sings through the pines,
then finally enter slumber to the crackling of embers
as the old house moans and sighs.

Maybe tonight, once again,
I'll dream of what used to be,
or perhaps finally I'll wake up, forever,
from this earth's cold, undying sleep.
