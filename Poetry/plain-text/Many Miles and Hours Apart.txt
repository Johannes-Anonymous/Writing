We are many miles and hours apart,
and tonight
my feet are bare against the boards.

I still have my old habits,
and I am gazing into the stars
as they gently appear,
like pinholes in the dusk.

Do you remember these little lights
before autumn, before summer?
May moon was rising,
and your skin was soft in its glow.

I took your hands in delight,
I touched your lips with trust,
and in that amber field
below the swelling moonlit clouds:

    I lowered myself upon my knee,
    and waited upon your word.
