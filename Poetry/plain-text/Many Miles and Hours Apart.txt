We are many miles and hours apart,
and tonight
my feet are bare against the boards.

I still have my old habits,
and I am still gazing into the stars
as they gently appear
like pinholes in the dusk.

Do you remember these little lights
before autumn, before summer?
May moon was rising,
and your skin was soft in its glow.

How did the words I gave you then
feel as you received them?
They were like knives across my tongue
as they left,
and I didn't realize they were hot and sharp
until they were gone.

They burned a hole between us,
and surrendered our shared grace.
Now I no longer wake to hope,
and my dreams have evaporated
— I can no longer taste them.

Yet, my desires for you remain;
but I have been waiting
— for a word of permission from the dark heavens —
for so long
that they seem dead.
