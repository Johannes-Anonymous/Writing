Your voice was lost in time —
Anne, could something so important just unwind?
Was there anything real if I've nothing left to hold?

Given up with patience, neck deep in resignation,
still believing answers only come to those with bloodied knees…
This year weighs like a lifetime, and two are another timeline entirely.

Is it pain enough to quit, have you been filled enough to give?
(Is it pain enough to give? You've been filled too much to quit.)
If this is right, what ever could be wrong?



Father's hand on the door, broken candle on the floor;
Quick: act, smother, and swallow the smoke.

Restless winds inside your head,
dreams better left unsaid;
Do you dare bring it up if you fear bringing it to life?



Killing time before an answer can be lived,
days until you'll take a step again.
You have her number, but do you have her heart?
