# Enter

Here, our stories begin before our births,

Here, we learn bird songs with our first words,

Here, there's always room for another
    on a mother's warm lap.



The seasons we know just by our weather,
    the longer shadows on the river,
    and new colors in the heather.
Calendars on paper?
    Not even for keeping records.

Our mortician and midwives always keep busy —
    church bells sing, endlessly ringing;
    our days are aging well, like wine.

Every neighborhood is claimed —
    sidewalks re-marked with child's chalk after each rain;
yet our front doors swing freely,
    the only boundaries being fields of grain.



So enter in, and welcome to our town:
    on a worn breakfast counter lay your elbows down —

Come in, and share your neighbor's joy.
