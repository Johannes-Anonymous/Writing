I sweep the hearth of dust and ash,
    while you uncover the kettle
    and struggle to light the stove.

Constantly, the wind is howling outside.
It rips the earth, lifts it, and carries it away,
    leaving us with less â€”
        when we already have nothing.

Dead dirt covers all,
    and it's a rare blessing
    to see even a sliver of sunlight.
I don't know how long it's been
    since we let the children play outside.

Across the room,
    the baby's breaths are loud, strained,
        and ignored.
I can't think of anything to do,
other than to keep waiting;

I try not to wonder about it.
I try not to wonder about anything.
