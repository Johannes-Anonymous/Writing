It started raining last night,
before I made it home.
The shutters were still open,
and I saw you through the windows,
lit by the reading lamp,
and I was soaked.

I was expecting that I'd have to knock,
just as when I was a child,
for night had come early with the rainclouds,
and I was feeling small and young again,
having skipped over the puddles on my way home.

Yet, you came to the door before me,
and had it open as I walked up.
I could see you smiling gently through the glass,
framed by the reflected streetlamps.
All light was yellow and warm,
and the breeze around me was soft amidst the rain.

For a moment I feared waking up,
I feared waking up and away from a life so rich and deep:
Was it not an injustice for this treasure to belong to me?
Could such abundance be freely granted to hearts poor as mine?

And wake up I did,
and you and the rain and the warm summer lights remained,
and I was changed â€”

    no more thought I gave to the key I accidentally left behind on my way out,
    or to the deadbolt I used to turn in the dark,
    or even to my name as it was before;

For now I know:
    the house is ours,
    and together, we each belong to the other.
