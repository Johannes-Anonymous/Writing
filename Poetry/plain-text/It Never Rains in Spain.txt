It never rains in Spain
Though the clouds stay all day
I am parched
But I'm never going away

This tin-roof top,
Hot as rocks,
Is keeping me awake
And wherever it is, I'm sure the sun still bakes

But here it's just the time that doesn't fade
Through the night or the grey-houred day
And despite the tree-line laughs
I'll still gladly wait

Patience is a gift for those with restraint
All I have to show is a rusted chain
My bad ankles swell, my throat is draped
My cough brings up blood, I wake up late

I may be silent but nonetheless
It's my red tennis shoes that have been taken away

Among the lines that some call shade
and a poison bitterness that takes
My minutes like water drops
Evaporating to waste
