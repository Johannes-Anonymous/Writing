# It Never Rains in Spain

It never rains in Spain,
though the clouds stay all day;
and wherever it is, I'm sure the sun still bakes.

This tin rooftop,
hot as rocks,
is keeping me awake;
forever parched and coughing blood,
I wake up late.

Here, time just doesn't fade,
even under the dark ghosts that some call shade;
I count my minutes like links in a rusted chain,
and feel my hours, like water drops,
evaporating to waste.
