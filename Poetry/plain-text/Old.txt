I was born,
One dark winter morning,
There was no fire warm.

My sun is cold,
This cup is empty,
I have lost home.

Gravel roads,
Misty showers,
The days fall slow.

Swollen graves,
Yards without fences,
Front doors with no names.

What I have
Tears my skin;
What I want
Cannot be given.

Time winds down
To a dead man's crawl.
