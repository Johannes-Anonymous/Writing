My dad bought us both
a pair of big, poofy slippers.

Today, I dropped a chef's knife on one of mine
while cooking for myself;
it was flayed wide open.

I could no longer wear it,
and without it, my skin was cold
against the stone floor.

I was afraid of going back to Dad,
for the slipper was a gift from him.

So I asked Mom to patch it,
and she said she would help me.

She brought me back to Dad
— which I was afraid of,
since the slipper was a gift from him —
and he gently looked me in the eye,
then sewed my slipper back together.

Now,
it is whole and stronger,
and my feet are warm,
and I know:
Dad loves Mom
and Dad loves me.
