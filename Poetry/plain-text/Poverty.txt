# Poverty

## Poverty
The sunrise bites hard.
I have holes in my curtains and they taunt me â€”
still, in bed, on the floor.

Today feels like yesterday.
Today feels like an endless drag on a stale, stiff cigarette.



## Acorns

Yesterday:
I swept the acorns from the yard,
and I found the keys I lost
last winter.

That tired, dirty snow
was too heavy for digging.



## TV

My boss called.

I wondered what he wanted,
and picked the remote back up.


## TV (take 2)

My boss called.

I wonder what he wants ...
What's on the next channel?


## Maybe

Is the gym still shut down?

Why am I asking?



## Xbox
I'm leaving my videogames
to my little brother if I die;
I put a post-it on the Xbox.

I wonder: does it still work?



## Expiration

The orange juice tastes bad,
but the expiration date isn't until next week.

Should I put the cap back on,
or keep it in the fridge?

Where did Mom go?
