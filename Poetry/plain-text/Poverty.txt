# Poverty

## Video Games

I'm leaving my vide ogames
to my little brother if I die;
I put a post-it on the Xbox.

Does the thing even work?





## Religion

I walked by the church,
and almost tried looking up at the steeples.

They used to remind me of something.





## Lost

Yesterday:
I swept the acorns from the yard,
and I found the keys I lost
last winter.

That tired, dirty snow
was too much for digging.

Where did that car go?





## Expiration

The orange juice tastes bad,
but the expiration date isn't until next week.

Should I put the cap back on?
Should I put it back in the fridge?

Where's Mom?





## TV

My boss is calling.

I guess he wants something.


What's on the next channel?





## Gym ( …or not )

Is the gym still shut down?

Why am I asking?





## Poverty

The sunrise bites hard.
I have holes in my curtains and they taunt me —
still, in bed, on the floor.

Today feels like yesterday.
Today feels like an endless drag on a stale, stiff cigarette.





## Quitting

Life .....      ugh.


why?
