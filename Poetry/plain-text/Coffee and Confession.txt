Tips of flesh,
fresh with wind-nipped
burn, coil around
coal-dark heat
in cup, while
naked sun sinks
over blue crystal
streets, sides piled
rough with slush
of travel-beaten
Heaven's dust.

Bright flakes
fall from pregnant
dark like inverted
sparks, as soul
floats stark
above blackened
shame, buoyed by
invading grace;
whose mood is
matched by glowing
moon, swimming in
stars,
and blessed
with solitude.
