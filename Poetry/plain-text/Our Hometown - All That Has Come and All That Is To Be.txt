# Our Hometown
(All That Has Come and All That Is To Be)

From my home to your post box
is a short and jolly jaunt,
a few dozen paces down the street
flanked by festive leaves on ancient trees,
and yards full of wildflowers and bees.

Our water tower reigns
like a plump contented king
who, every spring, renews his court
with scores of colorful birds that sing.

The schools are full of those who grow
and on ball fields the seeds of virtue sow,
whose names mark plaques,
the players and teams made State Champs.

On weekends, the restaurants are packed:
with work ended and assignments submitted,
couples long and newly smitten dance;
the ladies in muslin dresses spin to entrance
young men, who by calloused hands,
earned their pay for the dates.

Every good woman is first known as her father's,
and then her husband's own;
and each wife blesses all
with her art of transforming
a fresh house into a home.

Strawberries in sunlight
follow supper in summer;
with dishes cleaned, drying in the breeze,
we stay up and out, joining stars glistening like the sea,
celebrating all that has come
and all that is to be.
