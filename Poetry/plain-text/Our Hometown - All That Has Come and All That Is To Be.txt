# Our Hometown
(All That Has Come, and All That Is To Be)

From my home to your post box
is a short and jolly jaunt,
a few dozen paces down the street
flanked by festive leaves on ancient trees,
and yards full of wildflowers and bees.

Our water tower reigns
like a plump contented king
who, every spring, renews his court
with scores of colorful birds that sing.

The schools are full of those who grow
and on ball fields the seeds of virtue sow,
whose names mark plaques,
the players and teams made State Champs.

On weekends, the restaurants are packed:
with work ended and assignments submitted,
couples long and newly smitten dance;
ladies in muslin dresses spin to entrance
young men, strong with calloused hands.

Every new house becomes a home
under the artful care of a warm woman
who was first her father's, then her husband's own â€”
her man who left Mom and Pop to cherish her, and her alone.

And strawberries in sunlight
follow supper in summer;
with dishes cleaned, drying in the breeze,
we stay up and out, joining stars glistening like the sea,
celebrating all that has come
and all that is to be.
