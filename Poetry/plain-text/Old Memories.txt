I do not want
your boxes of old photographs,
or the lists of our ancestors.

I do not want
the old cards and gifts you've saved
from so many holidays.

Keep your heirloom rocking chair,
or throw it away â€”
I do not care.

Time has moved on,
and these things are behind me.

I do not want
memories which I cannot deny,
of when we used to love
and be happy.
