I have gazed through these windows for many years,
and have never seen the trees bare past spring.

I have gathered flowers from the outskirts
since we were carried by our mothers,
and their scents always accompany me home.

Yet, the morning dew has now lost its sweetness,
and the trill of birdsongs has been halved.
The rail yard is choked with weeds, the boxcars are nearly empty,
and smoke perpetually covers the horizon.

In every sunrise, I wonder if our rows of tombstones have grown.
