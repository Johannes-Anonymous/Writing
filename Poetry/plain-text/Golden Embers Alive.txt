We rise like ashes of bonfire
    on summer's trailing edge,
    (we are golden embers alive)
into the towering depths
    of liquid heaven above
    we sink,
we are poured out
    over aching woods and crumbling leaves.

We are homebound,
    meant for rest in dusty origin,
    living now with eternal flame
    immanent in our blood.
