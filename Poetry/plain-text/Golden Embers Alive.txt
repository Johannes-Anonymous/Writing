We rise like ashes of bonfire
    on summer's trailing edge,
    (we are golden embers alive)
into the towering depths
    of liquid heaven above
    we sink,
we are poured out
    over aching souls and stumbling hearts.

We are homebound,
    soaking the world
    with the eternal flame
    singing in our blood.
