# Woman (Terrific Black Wings)

Woman,

    I desire,

To guard the spark of life
    beneath terrific black wings,
to inspire dread
    in twisted hearts
    that openly conspire
        to consume
        the soft flesh
        of fresh life.

And so I need you to steady me
    and be an anchor for my heart,
    a warm bosom for my soul,
that my fire, my unsheathed scythe-like fury
    may be guided, righteous, and precise.

For I taste the rage
    boiling beneath our pain;
I know the full depths
    of the darkness cast upon us;
I hear the trembling
    in your voice as you wonder
    what may become of the names
    we have imagined for our young.


I will tolerate no more.


I, with every fiber of my body,
    will be a wrecking ball
    against our enemies,
and will crush their pride
    and mix their bones with the dust.
I, with you, will thrust the sword
    of truth through their lies
    to the beating of our hearts.

We will end their reign:

    Our children shall live,
    and our dreams will not be taken from us
    without our blood.
