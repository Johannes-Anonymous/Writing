# Woman (Terrific Black Wings)

Woman,

    I desire,

To guard the spark of life
    beneath terrific black wings,
to inspire dread
    in twisted hearts
    that openly conspire
        to consume
        the soft flesh
        of fresh life.

And so I need
    you to guide me back,
away from ravine's edge,
    to the wide level plain
    of fertile faith:

Faith in Love,
Faith in Joy,
Faith in a morning spent
    gathering and breaking wood for our hearth;
Faith that night can come as a friend
    of deep rest and just recompense.

For I wonder,
    as my heart breaks with memories:
What will become of the names
    we have imagined for our young?

And what will be born
    of the struggle we have shouldered
    with our nearly-clotted blood?

I wonder about the seasons,
    turning over and over our earth:
Will we let them lay down dark,
    fresh soil upon our souls?

And in the blue dusk before wakefulness,

    I pine for release
        from our sins and chains;

    I ache for the rising
        I know must come,
        for the warm wind yet unheard;

    I yearn for us
        to roam with strength into open air;

    I hunger, with every fiber of my body,
        for a turning:
            away from suffocation,
            and into cleansing light â€”

    I burn,

        with relentless desire,

            for the juggernaut of Truth
                                   to awaken.
