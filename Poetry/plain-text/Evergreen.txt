# Evergreen

Winter bears heavily
upon old trees,
bowed over the buried grass.

Autumn is long gone,
and I may be absent
the next time it comes to pass.

Yet there is a bird,
    or three,
warbling among the stubborn leaves,

whose song is a reminder
of the evergreen spring
that,
    I hope,
awaits me.
