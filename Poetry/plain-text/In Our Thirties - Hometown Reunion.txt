# In Our Thirties (Hometown Reunion)

I don't remember the last time we spoke;
it seems like forever since I was near you.
Now your breasts are long, your hips have changed;
you're bearing new life again, and I've racked up only empty days.

But I remember way back when:
a word from your lips, and my heart would skip over entire days;
and we had a few evenings warm:
walking until the stars came out, with moonlight on the barns.

Then there was your sudden scream and slap —
that black night around the lake,
when I reached for more than your hand;
So I left, and you had all those other men…
my heart's been chilled, and beating steady since:
a heavy ostinato of regret.

And though I kept up with all our friends,
somehow, from you, I wanted only silence.
I guess your pain was more than I could take:
because once I walked away, I made it a complete break.

And my couch has stayed empty without your form:
to the dead dream I've been faithful.
Everything from then is now cold or gone —
the moon is small, there's deep ice on the lake.

Then a decade dies, and a friend calls us back:
a hometown funeral turns into a reunion unplanned.
When I see you, I'm shocked that I have to catch my breath:
I thought that part of me was dead.

Well, I never learned your husband's name,
never saw a “Save-the-Date,” wouldn't know his face.
And I heard he stayed at home, just you and the kid took the plane;
Oh, why, when we meet, are you looking down?
I never wanted you to be ashamed.

And there's rivers of ink soaking your skin;
tell me — did these rough sleeves come before or after him?
And my stomach falls, seeing that glory's been taken from your face:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry — did I dig your heart's grave?

And I'm torn between myself and whose you are now:
my conscience says, “This flower's taken, John — move along.”
And it burns, again to yearn to hear my name in your voice,
knowing that we never were — that it was all my choice.
