# In Our Thirties (Hometown Reunion)

I don't remember the last time we spoke;
it seems like forever since I was near you.
Now your breasts are long, your hips have changed;
you're carrying new life again, and I've racked up only empty days.

But I remember way back when:
a word from your lips, and my heart would skip over entire days;
but then I left, and you had all those other men;
my heart's been chilled, and beating steady since:
a heavy ostinato of regret.

And though I kept up with all our friends,
somehow, from you, I wanted only silence.
Your smiles and tears were always more than I could take;
so when, for a moment, I thought you turned away,
I gave in to my fears, sought nothing but a complete break.

And my couch has stayed empty without your form:
to the dead dream I've been faithful;
everything from then is now cold or gone —
the moon is small, there's black ice on the lake.

Then a decade dies, and a friend calls us back:
a hometown funeral turns into a reunion unplanned.
When I see you, I'm shocked that I have to catch my breath —
I thought that part of me was dead, not just at rest.

Well, I never learned your husband's name,
never saw a “Save-the-Date,” wouldn't know his face.
And I heard he stayed at home, just you and the kid took the plane;
Oh, why, when we meet, are you looking down?
I never wanted you to be ashamed.

And there's rivers of ink soaking your skin;
tell me — did these rough sleeves come before or after him?
And my stomach falls, seeing that glory has left your face:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry — did I dig your heart's grave?

And I'm torn between myself and whose you are now:
my conscience says “This flower's taken, John — move along.”
And it burns, again to yearn to hear my name in your voice,
knowing that we never were — that it was all my free choice.
