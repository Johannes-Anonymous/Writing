I count the white peels of his face.
A flap of dead skin for every day,
maybe every week â€” Maybe,
every year.

He must tolerate pain slowly.

And when he calls me Brother,
I listen, as Skeptic.
When this frayed dog shares his bone with me,

    I shudder.

I am surely looking for a constraint,
another responsibility, so I do not have to face this one.

Hovering in the gray,
facing a broad-shouldered choice,

    I fall

with eyes open.
