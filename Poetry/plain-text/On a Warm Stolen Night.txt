# On a Warm, Stolen Night

On a warm, stolen night, I drove through town alone,
playing music as I cruised by all my friends' old homes.
I counted broken street signs to the songs of my youth,
then laid out in my driveway 'till the sky above turned blue.

The dewy morning air was a sign of changing seasons;
I hardly wanted out, but I looked for a reason.
The winds were calmly changing, I knew what they would bring:
one more lonely summer, spent down at Mineral Springs.

So I sat on my father's porch, in the worst time of the year:
friends driving by, saying “What are you doing here?”
We vanish in our cars, past the return point of sane,
but we'll all grow up to be like our parents, every one of the same.

We live our clichés, and no one complains:
this town is a box — we're free only in name.
Midnight comes and goes, and we're still awake;
we have nothing to give, and there's nothing left to take.
