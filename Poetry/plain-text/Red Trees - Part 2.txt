There is a twinge in the air,
and a yearning within me like a free-fall —
some tendency toward a certain change to the unknown.

I'm standing at Grandma's grave,
and Grandpa's is just a few feet to the left.
The last time I was here we were putting his remains in the ground,
and I remember packing snow under my feet
as I followed some cousins to bless the casket
with holy water from the priest;
he waited a long time before one of us
was brave enough to step forward.

I'd like my father to be with me, here, again,
to explain the stories I've heard and truths I've learned
since those days have passed.
I feel like I've stepped out of childhood, into a darkness,
and I don't know what's supposed to come next.



I'd like to revisit the places he shared with me when I was small,
and ask the questions I know now that I didn't before.



Beyond the basic details, like those in an elementary school biography,
I don't know much about my father's life as an adult before he met Mom;
he hasn't shared many of those stories with me.

I have no siblings by their blood,
and I wonder why.
I have seen my cousins flourish
like well-watered saplings in rich lawns,
but I have never felt the fostering hand
of a master gardener guiding me to maturity.

I know that long before I was born,
Dad and all his siblings left their town.
They went to other places to explore great careers,
and picked the best wives, husbands, and jobs
that the foreign lands could offer.

Now, though Grandma and Grandpa are gone,
the siblings still come back together, for moments, in their childhood town;
they are gathered like flashing but fading leaves in small cyclones
by weddings, funerals, class reunions —
things they enjoy, or are yet still bigger than themselves.
