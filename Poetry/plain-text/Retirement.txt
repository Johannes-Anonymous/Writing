# “I Thought I'd Be Happy Once I Retired”



Dead birds cover my lawn.
I haven't seen my neighbors in weeks.

I walked around my house last night
with the gas can.

I guess I'm thankful it wasn't empty at the end.

I found a letter in my mailbox today,
so someone wrote to me.
I'm sure it was full of lies,
so I just left it there and set the whole thing on fire.

I left the gas can in the ashes.

I still hate waking up,
and I still hate soggy cereal.
