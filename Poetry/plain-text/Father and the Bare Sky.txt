The bare and blue slate sky
yawns heavily on the flattop homes,

and chalk puffs of clouds rest lazily
above amber yards of clay.

In photographs, my young father
and his siblings would scatter over these sidewalks,
running out of church with arms wild
and smiles wide.

Today, I am pacing through
neighborhoods cold to my eyes
but colorful in my memories.
These streets, in years decades apart,
are where my father and I were both children.

When I was growing up,
he would take me along to visit his mom and dad;
it was just him and I.

I remember our Sunday mornings,
first in the pews and then around the kitchen table,
enjoying the best pancakes I have ever known.

I remember the books he read to me
in the room he shared with his brother;
I would fall asleep in the top bunk.

I remember our Saturday summer nights,
racing together on our bikes
to beat the sunset home, coasting and sweating on hills,
coming back from the lake.

I remember our starts on Friday mornings
— especially when I got to skip class —
driving up under glowing clouds,
nearly bouncing on the radio waves of 60's pop,
stopping at gas stations bordering wheat fields,
and walking out with salty snacks under a rising sun.



[ a fragment I'd like to work up to near the end: ]

First, the acorns fell.
Soon after, a twinge entered the trees.
Now the leaves shiver and fly
in the white north wind.
