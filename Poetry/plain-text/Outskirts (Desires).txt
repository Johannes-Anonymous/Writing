I have gazed through these windows for many years,
and have never seen the trees bare past spring.

I have gathered flowers from the outskirts
since we were carried by our mother,
and their scents always return to me at her sight.

I have burned in August sun at the rivers,
with sunglow reaching from above and below.

Yet, most of our streets I cannot name,
though I know them by sight and sound;
barefoot, many times, have I crossed over this town.

My roots, like yours, go deep into these acres and through decades,
and our memories outnumber the tombstones
(may they outlive them, too).

On my own I have ached with anticipation
through many rich-blue nights,
through many autumn frosts heralding winter with bright, stiff yellow leaves;

I have sought to satiate my thirst beneath the stars,
though only half-knowing how;
and my desires
    (ever leading forward,
    with content unclear
    and sources obscured)
have not met their ends.
