A heart â€”
upon which to rest;
that I may take my own up again,
renewed.

If not,
then a battle against an enemy seen to forge my soul,
and create of it a weapon against death.

If neither,
then a brother amidst faceless struggle,
another to strain alongside;
he an embodied reminder of some Life beyond us.

For I expect,
until I accept to gaze above and release my grip:
these desert nights will yet shed more heat and grow beyond their bounds,
and the silent shadows will strengthen and blend with the darkening, empty ground.
