# Friend (Departure)

## All text is center-aligned. The "Step in, Step forward ..." text is italicized

May your departure bring tears to these hearts,
May your death be easy and sweet,
May the saints rejoice to see you,
And may they pave the way
with roses at your feet.

Step in, Step forward,

Step in, Step forward,

Step in, Step forwardâ€¦
