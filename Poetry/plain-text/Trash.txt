# Trash

It's dark.
It's morning.
I try sleeping through the wind beating the trees,
but I can't.

So I take off the sheets
and put my bare feet to the floor, to stand —
the cold shock wakes me up.

I haven't been awake this early for years,
so I go through the house, turning on the lights.
I find the curtains disarrayed,
    the dishes on the wrong side of the sink,
        and our photos covered in dust.

We were together for ten years.

Last week, she left.

Left, as in gone-for-good,
    like it was her right,
        like we'd be better for it,
            like I should be grateful for it.

She left with nearly nothing to say,
    like there was nothing to save,
        like we couldn't change,
            like “we” didn't mean a thing.



This house aches in the wind.

I go back to the kitchen for the trash,
and the floor creaks as I take it out.
Before last week, I would have thrown on my coat,
but now I don't care about the cold.

Under the black sky,
the wild wind beats my bare head.
I don't know when the sunrise is coming,
but I know I'm not falling back asleep.

Yet, the trash bin seems so far away.
