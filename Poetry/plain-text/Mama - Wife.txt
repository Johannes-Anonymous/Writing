# Mama (Wife)

Mama, do I have a sister waiting, a woman in white?
Do I have muscle and love enough to serve?

My kitchen remains bare,
no matter the stacks of dishes, dirty or clean,
and my red Mustang is gathering dust, not miles.

I know the weather will be changing
as spring comes again, with another full moon.
Yet I feel untouched and unreachable,
like the rusty rooster atop my cold roof.

Will you remind me why I am seeking a friend,
why I should want a wife?
Outside, I see only bare, brittle branches,
and all my leaves are brown, scattered in the street.

I keep waking up later and later,
and I'm forgetting more and more of my reasons to rise.
