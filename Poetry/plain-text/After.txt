Your sandals I've become familiar with,
even after having them just a week.
Your bike squeaks when I pump the brakes,
and I'm not sure if I'll keep it.

Are you above, within, around?
How is it that I am so sure of your hearing?
I wasn't taught this,
but I know it, and it's alive in my bones.

At the auction, I saw your housecleaner.
She mentioned your long goodbye before your final trip west;
even in that moment, she knew to remember it.

And your neighbors, are they expecting anything?
I know tools and tips went back-and-forth between you freely,
but their names I never learned.

As for me, I'm still not used to seeing the sun rise in the living room
without the smell of your cinnamon pancakes and splattering bacon coming from the kitchen.


Mom left.

We don't know where she went,
but she left most of her clothes with us â€”
she might return.

You won't.
