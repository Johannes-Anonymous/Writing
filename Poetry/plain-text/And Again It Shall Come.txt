# And Again, It Shall Come

(the image that goes along with the poem)

Looking over a harvested field at the end of winter
— some snow remains (just patches) and is melting;
the air is chilled but the sunlight is warm;
trees are bare and not yet budding;
the sky is blue with scattered, thin, airy clouds — wispy.




(the poem)


And again, it shall come…
And again, it shall come…
And again, we shall grow.
