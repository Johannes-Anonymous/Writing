8 A.M., October,
in the backseat,
turned around, on my knees,
I watch our house disappear,
swallowed by the trees.

We drive all day,
taking a single break.
My stomach aches
after chasing fast-food wrappers
through the parking lot,
the greasy parchment rolling
like whitecaps on a lake.

The sun drops down
as we pull into our new town.
By bedtime I've forgotten its name â€”
I missed the sign, and there was no welcoming parade.

So on my bed,
too weary to think,
I count the stars,
floating like diamonds in black ink.
I quit early, though,
giving in to sleep.

In the morning,
though our kitchen table is the same,
breakfast feels strange;
the views, the sunlight, are different,
and I am misdirected,
like a broken weathervane.

Back upstairs, I unpack my clothes,
hoping this becomes my new favorite home.
Do the kids in town shoot hoops?
Do they, too, stargaze from the roofs?

This afternoon, it rains,
while my beloved books are still buried away.

Do I remain indoors,
bored, comfortable, and dry,
or do I look for new friends
in the strange, wild weather outside?
