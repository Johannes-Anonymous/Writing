Goodbye weekend
I'm gonna miss your relaxed days
And the time I could sit back and
Waste away

I will remember the sunshine
And the threat of rain
I can see the streets of downtown
And tell how I don't feel the same

I choked on humid air
And picked up the phone
I called all my friends
And received a dial tone

So I lit my fires
And stayed outside
I quenched my wants
By burning time

I walked through fields
And biked down hills
Climbed up trees
And stayed off pills

You weren't there
At all the places I stayed
I conquered my fears
Sang “Wish You Were Here”

If this is goodbye
I'm content to go
Will I make through tomorrow's week
I don't know

My hands are shot
I haven't warmed up
I jump In cold
To a week I trust
