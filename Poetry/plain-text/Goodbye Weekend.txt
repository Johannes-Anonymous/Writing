Goodbye weekend:
I'm gonna miss your relaxed days,
and the time I could sit back and
waste away.

I will remember the sunshine,
and the threat of rain;
I see the streets of downtown,
and I know I won't feel the same.

I choked on humid air,
and picked up the phone;
I called all my friends
â€” nothing but dial tones.

So I lit my fires,
and stayed outside;
I quenched desires
by burning time.

I walked through fields,
and biked down hills,
climbed up trees,
and stayed off pills.

If this is goodbye,
I'm content to go.
Will I make it through tomorrow's week?
I don't know.
