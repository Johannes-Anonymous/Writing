The children are gone.
I never wanted them,
until you and I met.

Now I miss them,
their contagious and merry laughs,
and the rumble they made
when running through our house.

Sometimes our feet would find their toys in the bedsheets,
and I would smile sleepily, rolling over to put them on the nightstand.
You'd softly kiss my shoulder.

Then there were the Saturday mornings
when we'd shuffle out of the bedroom
and find the kitchen a mess
from their spilled milk and cereal.
We'd step over their Lego cities in the living room
and tousle their hair and fix the curtains,
the rascals playing in the warm squares of the rising sun.

Having ice cream at the park was always a delightful mess.
I'd chuckle for the kids coming later,
who would find the monkey bars and swings sticky with chocolate.
You would always look so cute,
corralling our little ones to have them help wipe off some of their work.

As they grew up,
we'd take them all around town —
to where we met, where we had our dates,
and where their grandparents lived.
“Our bones go back here a long time,” we'd say,
visiting the graves of our ancestors.
You'd have them take turns with the holy water,
sprinkling the stones.

And years later, as we helped the kids find jobs, schools, and spouses,
you'd cry tears of joy and sorrow as they moved up and away.
On cold nights I felt your warm heart pound heavily
behind our closed door.

Now the yard looks empty without them,
and the kitchen is too quiet without their voices.
Is the garage finally big enough,
without all their bikes?

The sparkle in your smile hasn't changed since our first date,
but now a somber blue ache lives beneath it.

I am grateful for you.
I am grateful for us.
