(to the tune of "Funeral Singers")

Spark when naked
as you turn out the light
a snapping of wrists,
your bones go (into) to mine

And all the night
bears down so heavy
a lead blanket
a weight, warm and ready

So much death, so much to spare
and the little ones,
with brown teddy bears

Take me over
Take me over

I know not, for what I wish
Was there a line off-key, a cue I missed?

Now you sing
Now you sing

from below our feet
from underneath

Take my hand
hold your breath
resurface in shame, valium and piss

I know not,
not what I miss

May the match
not take up fire
to go out
with just a hiss
