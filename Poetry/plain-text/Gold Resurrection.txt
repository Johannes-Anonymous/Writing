Will you unearth it with me,
    what I've come to find â€”
what has been buried
    through apathy, regrets; in short, wasted time?
No matter how coal-black
    that dead weight may appear,
I know we can bring it back to gold
    by shared blood and hot tears:

for a dream across generations,
    neglected, forgotten, unsung,
may become tarnished, rusted, and withered,
    but not yet undone;
for the threads of redemption
    never leave our hands.
