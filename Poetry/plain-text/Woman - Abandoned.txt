# Woman (Abandoned)

I've been sleeping below streetlamps,
    reclined in my passenger seat,
and spitting out days
    like the seeds piled around my pedals.

Rosco hides from the sun in the footwell,
    his tail rarely thumping.
He's been slowly dying,
    for months.

We're stuck in some skidmark town,
    by circumstance.
I left Angie, my wife,
    by choice.

Judging by the bottles and cans,
    I've been gone for weeks.

I didn't keep any photographs of her,
    except the one already taped to the dash.
Despite digging through memories on repeat,
    I haven't found any treasure.

I started praying again —
    if yelling at the clouds,
    and wanting somebody to hear,
        counts.

I don't miss her.
But I miss the nights
when heartbeats marked our time.

I was never satisfied with her…
    I've been looking for my mother
        in every other woman's eyes.
