# In the Backseat

8 A.M., in the backseat,
turned around, on my knees,
I watch our house disappear,
swallowed by the trees.

We drive all day,
taking a single break.
My stomach aches,
chasing fast-food wrappers
through the parking lot,
the greasy parchment rolling
like whitecaps on a lake.

The sun drops down
as we pull into our new town.
By bedtime I've forgotten its name â€”
I missed the sign,
and there was no welcoming parade.

So on my bed,
too weary to think,
I count the stars,
floating like diamonds in black ink.
I quit early,
giving in to sleep.

In the morning,
though our kitchen table is the same,
the views, the sunlight, are different,
so breakfast feels strange.
