# Woman (I Desire)

Woman,

    I desire;

To build you a brick house
with wide wooden steps
coming up from the lawn;

To lean a broom on the front porch,
and with you wait while
we let friends, like leaves,
gather.

We'll bunch them around bonfires
on crisp autumn nights,
and our stories and songs
will rise and scatter
amidst the fireflies.

And below the hymns of shooting stars,
our little ones will gently run about
and slowly fall to sleep.


Woman,

    I desire;

To wake by your side
with windows open wide,
and to waltz into our kitchen white
and bright with sun,
your sharp eyes glowing like coals;

To call our children down with our laughter,
and to feel their pant-leg tuggings
as we flip the flapjacks and skim off the cream;
to have the table set happily, messily,
by the youngest three;

To repair bikes and kiss bruised knees,
and together count goslings in the spring;
to play hop-scotch on the sidewalk
and “catch” down the street.

And our dreams will grow heavy and full with age,
and life will be vibrant and deep.


Woman,

    I desire;

To build you a brick house
that we may pass on,
to leave our names engraved
on the pillars of many joyful hearts.
