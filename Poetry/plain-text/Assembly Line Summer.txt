# Assembly Line Summer

Ten-hour shifts, filling up my summer with sweat:
Oh, I remember those nights.

I carried steel, and grew up without gaining wisdom.
Oh, I learned a lot.


Do you know the strain of muscles against your shirt,
or the shriveling and shivering of your soul under fluorescent lights?
I have felt both, while watching freight trains disappear into darkness.

Do you know the weight of exhaustion, borne before work even begins?
I remember counting days, and sleeping in despair.

Do you know what death looks like on a living face?
I have seen it, and I know their names.


I have learned where the barely-living and the lonely stand before their shifts,
and I have seen them shuffle over unswept floors, with bowing backs,
to line up at the punch-out clock at night's end.

I have learned the hopeless weight of my lunchbox,
both empty and full, in my small and calloused hands,
and I have grown to ignore the rain on my walk home.

I have learned, at the end of my day,
to stand in my shower, numb,
without caring if I come out clean.


I have stood naked
before my death.
