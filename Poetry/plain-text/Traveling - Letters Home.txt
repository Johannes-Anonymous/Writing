# Travel — Letters Home

(early November)

Dear Sister,

Last night I was holding the phone,
and had even put in quarters while waiting for the train.
I suppose you already know that I didn't call…
I'm still not sure what I'd say to Dad.

I've gone north, and Canada is so close;
it used to seem impossibly far away to me as a child.

You can have my room if you want
(if Mom and Dad will let you).
How long do you think I'd have to be gone
before they put away my wrestling trophies?
I never actually won a tournament match
— they were just for participation.

I'm sorry if I made you cry by leaving,
like the time I went to camp for a month.
I didn't go just to hurt you,
though I'm sure it feels that way.



(late November)

I'm on my way west now, and I've had to buy warmer clothes.
Did you know they make woolen hats with sun-brims and knit gloves without fingertips?
I hadn't seen such things until New York —
I also saw people sleeping on the sidewalks.

I heard that Maine has a beautiful autumn,
but I was late.
The brackish rivers were filled with leaves,
and the trees looked like brittle sticks.



(December)

What do you think middle age will be like?
I miss our mornings and and evening conversations together,
but in the quiet, away from home,
I feel a little less constrained…
I think I've been living selfishly and small.

I think today is a Saturday.
There's a bird on the streetlamp on the corner ahead of me,
and the sun is making its slow rising,
and I think I'm coming back.

Life is going to be different.
