From my home to your post box is a short and jolly jaunt,
a few dozen paces down the street flanked by festive leaves
on ancient trees and yards of wildflowers and bees.

Our water tower reigns like a plump contented king
who's often holding court to scores of colorful birds that sing.

Children of hope fill little boats, running sails and paddles
across and to the lake under glorious sun and in the rain.

A driver's license oft anticipates a first date,
and every young man has calloused hands and steady feet that dance.

The good women are first known as their father's and then their husband's own,
and they bless all with the art of transforming a house into a home.

Strawberries follow dinner on the back porch while clean dishes dry in the breeze,
and we nap before bedtime, waking up under stars glistening like the sea.

Restaurants are packed on Friday nights with work ended and assignments submitted,
and families celebrating all that has come and all that is to be.
