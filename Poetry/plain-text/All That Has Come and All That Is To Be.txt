From my home to your post box
is a short and jolly jaunt,
a few dozen paces down the street
flanked with festive leaves on ancient trees
and yards full of wildflowers and bees.

Our water tower reigns
like a plump contented king.
often holding court to scores
of colorful birds that sing.

Restaurants are packed on Saturday nights
with friends spending time and sharing life,
their work ended and assignments submitted.

A driver's license oft anticipates
a first date, and every young man
has earned calloused hands
and deftly trained his feet in dance.

Our good women are first known
as their father's and then their husband's own,
and they bless all with their art
of transforming a house into a home.

Strawberries in sunlight
follow supper in summer;
with dishes cleaned, drying in the breeze,
we stay up and out, joined by stars that glisten like the sea,
celebrating all that has come
and all that is to be.
