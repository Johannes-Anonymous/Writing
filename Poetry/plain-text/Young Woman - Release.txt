# Young Woman (Release)

Young woman,
        with whom I will
            gladly share my name:
    I am a faulty wire hot with current,
        yearning for release.

For my dreams have been pent up for ages,
    and my hands I have just untied.

I imagine you a gentle safeguard
        for my heart's hopes,
    and a mighty sail
        for its desires yet untried.
