The ground in the town square no longer freezes,
except after a burial.
We don't bother with headstones anymore.

We count the stars above us,
just pins of light,
stillborn without pattern or motion.
They are unworthy of names.

From crooked, rotting porches,
mothers with thin dresses
call children to bed.
The screen doors always slam.

Young women,
whom we once called maidens,
no longer long for new names,
and they ignore their mirrors.

With overgrown limbs and hair,
boys wander down thistle-filled tracks
rattling rocks in their empty beers.
They whistle for mutts, and beat them.

Many of our mothers have other kids,
but we haven't heard the words “brother” and “sister”
for many years.

Fathers are not even a memory,
but merely a petrified dream.

Infants wail
through the black night.
Soon, we hope to forget
the sound of crying.
