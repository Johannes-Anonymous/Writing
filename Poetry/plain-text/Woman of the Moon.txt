(to be set to music)

[verse]
Seeking hard-earned consolation;
    stuck in place: lead weight, heavy resignation.
Anxious, burning days of tribulation;
    junk heart — termination.

[chorus]
If I drown —
    Will you give me rise from under?
Oh, woman of the moon —
    Will you lead me back through beauty?

[verse]
Broken hopes, bitter anticipation;
    last chance, missed dance; twitching hesitation.
Steel eyes, self-centered determination;
    hard-morning examination.

[chorus]
Can I pull through
    dark hours of heavy thunder?
Only when lightning strikes
    do I know my heart.

[chorus]
Blest are you —
    and I wish I could be gentle;
Pray for me —
    at the hour of separation:

    Take me through your heart
        to the one you love.
