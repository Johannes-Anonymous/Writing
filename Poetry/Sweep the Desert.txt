To sweep the desert
    bare with holy wind
    until it be free of sand,
to wander outside your cold house
    until you walk out again,
to dance with you on repeat
    on fields of deep cool grass;
For these I fought,
    endured,
    and hoped -
and yet my damp mornings
    have not yet been shaken
    bare of silt.
