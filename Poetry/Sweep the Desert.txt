To sweep the desert
    bare with holy wind
    until it be free of sand,
to wander outside your cold house
    until you walk out again,
to dance with you on repeat
    on fields of deep cool grass;

I have fought,
I have endured,
and I hope,
    yet -

Even if your freedom
    were uncovered,
even if you breathed open air
    again,
even if you heard your heart
    beat with nature's song...

- my coarse mornings
    have not been settled
    or shaken bare,
and I tremble
    for you.
